<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The question most frequently asked me since I
began my stay in South America has been:
"Why do they have so many revolutions there?"
Possibly the events recounted in the following pages
may help the reader to answer this for himself. I
hope that he will share my conviction that militarism
has already definitely disappeared from more than
half the continent and is slowly becoming less powerful
in the remainder. Constitutional traditions, inherited
from Spain and Portugal, implanted a
tendency toward disintegration; Spanish and Portuguese
tyranny bred in the people a distrust of all
rulers and governments; the war of independence
brought to the front military adventurers; civil disorders
were inevitable, and the search for forms of
government that should be final and stable has been
very painful. On the other hand, the generous impulse
that prompted the movement toward independence
has grown into an earnest desire for
ordered liberty, which is steadily spreading among
all classes. Civic capacity is increasing among the
body of South Americans and immigration is raising
the industrial level. They are slowly evolving among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>themselves the best form of government for their
special needs and conditions, and a citizen of the
United States must rejoice to see that that form is
and will surely remain republican.</p>

<p>It is hard to secure from the tangle of events
called South American history a clearly defined
picture. At the risk of repetition I have tried to
tell separately the story of each country, because
each has its special history and its peculiar characteristics.
All of these states have, however, had
much in common and it is only in the case of the
larger nations that social and political conditions
have been described in detail. A study of either
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, or Venezuela is likely to
throw most light on the political development of the
continent, while Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia are
more interesting to the seeker for local colour and
the lover of the dramatic.</p>

<p>The South American histories so far written treat
of special periods, and few authorities exist for post-revolution
times. Personal observations through a
residence of six years in South America; conversations
with public men, scholars, merchants,
and proprietors; newspapers and reviews, political
pamphlets, books of travel, and official publications,
have furnished me with most of my material for the
period since 1825. The following books have been
of use in the preparation of the first volume, and
are recommended to those who care to follow up
the subject:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Argentina</span>: Mitre's <i>Historia de Belgrano and
Historia de San Martin</i>, in Spanish; Torrente's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
<i>Revolucion Hispano-Americano</i>, in Spanish; Lozano's
<i>Conquista del Paraguay, La Plata y Tucuman</i>,
in Spanish; Funes's <i>Historia de Buenos Aires y
Tucuman</i>, in Spanish; Lopez's <i>Manuel de Historia
Argentina</i>, in Spanish; Page's <i>La Plata</i>, in English;
Graham's <i>A Vanished Arcadia</i>, in English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paraguay</span>: All of the above and Thompson's
<i>Paraguayan War</i>, in English; Washburn's <i>History
of Paraguay</i>, in English; Fix's <i>Guerra de Paraguay</i>,
in Portuguese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uruguay</span>: Bauza's <i>Dominacion Espanola</i>, in Spanish;
Berra's <i>Bosquejo Historico</i>, in Spanish; Saint-Foix's
<i>L'Uruguay</i>, in French.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brazil</span>: Southey's <i>History of the Brazil</i>, in
English; Varnhagem's <i>Historia do Brasil</i>, in Portuguese;
Pereira da Silva's <i>Fundacao do Imperio,
Segundo Periodo, Historia do Brasil, e Historia do
Meu Tempo</i>, in Portuguese; Nabuco's <i>Estadista do
Imperio</i>, in Portuguese; Rio Branco's sketch in <i>Le
Bresil en 1889</i>, in French; Oliveira Lima's <i>Pernambuco</i>,
in Portuguese.</p>

<p>All of the above books may be found in the Columbian
Memorial Library of the Bureau of American
Republics at Washington, which, taken as a whole,
is one of the best collections on South America in
existence.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERIES AND THE CONQUEST</h3>


<p><i>Spain's Discovery of America.</i>&mdash;Town or communal
government has been characteristic of Spain
since before the Roman conquest. The Visigoths,
who destroyed the advanced civilisation they found
in the Peninsula, never really amalgamated with the
subject population, and, happily, they did not succeed
in destroying the municipalities. The liberal,
civilised, and tolerant Saracens who drove out the
Goths, left their Christian subjects free to enjoy
their own laws and customs. The municipalities
gave efficient local self-government while a system
of small proprietorships made the Peninsula prosper,
as in the best days of the Roman dominion. The
population of Spain reached twenty millions under
the Moors, but finally dynastic civil wars enabled the
remnant of Visigoths who had taken refuge in the
northern mountains to begin the gradual expulsion
of the Mahometans. In the midst of these currents
of war and conquest setting to and fro, the old
municipalities survived unchangeable, and always
supplying local self-government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>A tendency toward decentralisation was ingrained
in the Spanish people from the earliest times. It
was increased by the method in which the Christian
conquest of Mahometan Spain was achieved. The
Visigothic nobility, starting from separate points in
Asturias and Navarre, advanced into Saracen territory
and established counties and earldoms which
were virtually independent of their mother-kingdoms.
The Asturians expanded into Leon and
thence over Galicia, northern Portugal, Old and
New Castile. The power of the Leonese monarch
over Galicia was nominal; Castile and Portugal separated
from Leon almost as soon as they were wrested
from the Mahometans. The Basques were always
independent, and Navarre, though it became the
mother of Aragon, had little connection with the
latter region. On the Mediterranean shore Charlemagne
drove the Moors from Catalonia and made it
a province of his empire, but no sooner was he dead
than it became independent. Toward the end of the
thirteenth century. The Christian conquest was virtually
completed, and the Peninsula had been divided
into four kingdoms. Each of these was, however, in
reality only a federation of semi-independent feudal
divisions and municipalities united by personal allegiance
to a single sovereign. In the course of the
continual quarrelling of the monarchs their kingdoms
frequently divided, coalesced, and separated again.
The death of a king or the marriage of his daughter
was often the signal for war and a readjustment of
boundaries, but these overturnings did not much affect
the component and really vital political units.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>More significant than the political kingdoms were
the linguistic divisions. Spain then spoke, and still
speaks, three languages, each of which has many
dialects. From Asturias and Navarre the language,
now known as Castilian, had spread over the central
part of the Peninsula south to Cadiz and Murcia.
From Galicia the Gallego had spread directly south
along the Atlantic, where one of its dialects grew
into the Portuguese. On the east coast the Catalonian,
imported from Languedoc by the French
conqueror, is a mere derivative of the Proven&ccedil;al.
Its dialects are spoken all along the Mediterranean
coasts of Spain as far south as Alicante, as well as
in the Balearic islands.</p>

<p>By 1300 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> two great political divisions, Castile
and Aragon, covered three-fourths of the Peninsula,
and their boundaries were well established; each,
however, was a mere loose aggregation of provinces,
and every province had its own laws and customs,
its jealously guarded privileges, its legislative assembly,
and its free municipalities. Galicia had never
become incorporated with Leon; the Basques ruled
themselves; Catalonia was really independent of
Aragon; Castile had, from the beginning, been
virtually independent, although under the same
monarch as Leon, and, indeed, had taken the latter's
place as the metropolitan province of the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p>The one great unifying force was religious sentiment,
stimulated into fanaticism by centuries of wars
against the infidels. Nevertheless, during the two
centuries before the discovery of America the
Spaniards absorbed much culture from their Moorish
subjects. In 1479, the whole Peninsula, except
Portugal and Granada, was politically united by the
accession of Ferdinand to the throne of Aragon, and
of Isabella to that of Castile and Leon. With local
liberties intact, and peace prevailing throughout its
whole extent, the Peninsula enjoyed a prosperity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>unknown since the golden era of the Moors. The
population rose to twelve millions; Andalusia,
Galicia, Catalonia, and Valencia were among the
most flourishing and thickly settled parts of Europe,
while the military qualities of the aristocracy of Castile
and Leon and Aragon gave the new power the
best armies of the time.</p>

<p>Colonies founded by a monarchy so organised
could never be firmly knit to each other nor to the
mother country. The nobility of the sword would
try to establish feudal principalities; the new cities
would endeavour to exercise the local functions of
the old Peninsular municipalities; and the spirit
of local independence still animating Catalonians,
Basques, Galicians, and Andalusians would be repeated
on a new continent. The only bond of union
would be personal allegiance to the monarch.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century, Christian navigators
reached the Canary Islands&mdash;sixty miles from the
African coast and six hundred south-east of Gibraltar.
The assurance that land did really exist below the
horizon of that western ocean, so mysterious and
terrible to the early navigators, gave them confidence
to push farther into the deep. In navigation,
the Spaniards lagged behind their Portuguese neighbours.
But among the Spanish kingdoms Castile
took the lead because her Andalusian ports of Cadiz,
San Lucar, Palos, and Huelva faced on the open Atlantic.
These towns swarmed with sailors who had
followed in the track of the Portuguese and visited
their new possessions. The Castilians and Andalusians
were naturally jealous of the successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Portuguese. Madeira, the Azores, the Cape Verdes,
and the gold mines of the Guinea coast had fallen
to the latter, while the Spaniards had only the
Canaries. They gave an eager ear to the rumours
that were rife in the Portuguese islands of more
marvellous discoveries still to be made&mdash;of islands
beyonds the Azores. An adventurous Italian,
Christopher Columbus, wandering among the Portuguese
possessions, heard the stories. Happily for
Spain, he believed them and resolved to lead an expedition
to the farther side of the Atlantic. He
entered her service and proved to be an enthusiast
of rare pertinacity. It is immaterial whether the
idea of a route to the East Indies by the west
occurred to him at the same time he became convinced
that there were islands in the far Atlantic
waiting to be discovered. That which is certain
is that he devoted his life to persuading someone
in authority to entrust him with ships and
men to make a voyage to the far West. The pilots
at Palos backed him, and he finally secured the desired
permission and means from Isabella of Castile.
Her interest in exploration and colonisation had
been shown fifteen years before, in her energetic
measures in conquering the Canaries and forcing
the Portuguese to renounce their claims to those
islands, and she well deserves the title of founder of
the colonial empire of Spain.</p>

</div>

<p>The story of Columbus's first voyage needs no retelling.
He journeyed so far to the west that he
returned convinced he had reached the longitude of
eastern Asia, and the noise of his great discovery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>resounded through Europe and began the transformation
of the world. Since the last great century&mdash;the
thirteenth&mdash;Christendom had retrograded.
The Tartars dominated Russia and the Turks were
pressing hard on Germany. Unless the Christian
world could find an outlet&mdash;unless it could create
other resources for itself and outside of itself; unless
feudalism should find an employment for its military
energies outside of the vicious circle of fruitless and
purposeless dynastic wars, it seemed not improbable
that Mahometan aggression would continue until all
Europe lay under the deadening influence of the
Turk. Only in the Peninsula was apparent that
spirit of expansion which is the best indication of
internal vitality in a nation. The military nobility,
whose determined fanaticism, magnificent courage,
and spirit of individual initiative had driven the
Moors out of Spain in the thirteenth century, welcomed
this fresh opportunity to slay the infidel and
carve out new fiefs for themselves.</p>

<p><i>Conquest of the Andes.</i>&mdash;Columbus showed strategic
genius of the highest order in choosing Hayti as
the site of the first settlement. That island afforded
an admirable base for the conquest of the New
World. It was large enough to furnish provisions,
and was conveniently situated with reference to the
coasts and islands of the Caribbean. Gold washings
were soon discovered in the interior and the unwarlike
inhabitants were at once impressed into slavery
to dig in the mines. The news of gold stimulated
interest as nothing else could have done. The Castilian
government took immediate steps to exclude all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
other nations. The Pope divided the globe between
Spain and Portugal, and a treaty to this effect
was negotiated between the two countries. Spaniards
swarmed over to Hayti, and thence expeditions
were sent out in every direction, headed by private
adventurers bearing their sovereign's commission.
The other Antilles were soon explored and, by the
end of the century, the Spaniards had reached the
South American mainland and rapidly explored its
coast from the Amazon up to the Isthmus. Gold
was picked up in the streams flowing from the
Columbian Andes into the Caribbean. A few years
later the north-western coast of South America was
granted out to noble adventurers who undertook
its conquest and exploitation with their own means.
The Isthmian region became the new centre of
Spanish power and commerce in America. In 1513,
Balboa crossed the Isthmus to the Pacific Ocean&mdash;an
event second in its far-reaching consequences
only to Columbus's first voyage. During the following
years the Gulf of Mexico was explored, and in
1518 the greatest statesman and general whom Spain
ever sent to the new world&mdash;Hernando Cortes&mdash;began
the conquest of the empire of the Aztecs.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The
mining done in Hayti and along the Caribbean
coast seemed pitiably insignificant compared
with the treasures found in Mexico. There followed
a new influx of gentleman adventurers who scoured
the coast in every direction seeking another defenceless
empire and mines as good as those of Mexico.
The expeditions down the Pacific coast of South
America started from the Isthmus. Peru was soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
found, and in 1532, Pizarro and his band of blood-thirsty
desperadoes, with inconceivable audacity,
struck a vital blow at the heart of the great empire
of the Incas by capturing its emperor. Within half
a dozen years nearly the whole of the vast region
over which the Inca power had extended was overrun
and the outlying provinces were ready to submit
at demand.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which a little band of Spaniards
conquered the vast and warlike empire of the
Incas is well-nigh incredible. The terror inspired
by horses and firearms did much, but the capture
of their emperor demoralised the imperial Inca tribes
still more. Once in the possession of the sacred person
of the monarch, the Spaniards were regarded by
the Indians as his mouthpiece and the successor to his
power. From Cuzco, the capital, a splendid system
of roads and communications radiated to every part
of the empire. The military and political dominance
of the imperial tribes had weakened the power
of resistance in the provinces. The elaborate structure
which had been built up by the Incas rather
facilitated than hindered the Spanish conquest, once
the decisive blow had been given at the centre. The
provinces submitted to the new rulers as fast as the
Spanish columns could march over the magnificent
mountain roads.</p>

<p>South from Cuzco the Inca empire extended
2000 miles. It covered the whole Andean region
as far as the 37th degree of south latitude and extended
from the Pacific to the eastern slopes of
the Andean foothills.  In the present Argentine it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
included the tribes living in the lesser chains which
occupy the north-western part of the republic.
Some of these Argentine tribes seem to have been
only tributary to the Incas, others were completely
dependent, and extensive colonies had been founded
in the cotton regions. The general language was
Inca, and that admirable system of irrigation and
intensive culture which made Peru proper a garden
had been introduced on the eastern slopes of
the southern Andes.</p>

<p>The southern part of the great Bolivian plateau
seems to have submitted quietly to the Spanish
conquerors, and the stream of adventurers passed on
to the south. In 1542, Diego de Rojas led the first
expedition, of which a record has survived, down
through the Humahuaca valley into the actual territory
of the Argentine. He himself perished in a
fight with a wild tribe near the main chain of the
Andes, but his followers continued their march.
Near Tucuman, they passed out from the mountain
defiles unto the pampa, and, leaving the desert to
their right penetrated through Santiago and Cordoba,
to the Paran&aacute;.</p>

<p>No permanent settlement was then made, but the
reports of thousands of peaceable and wealthy Indians
inhabiting irrigated valleys, and the accounts
of the magnificent pastures which stretched away
to the east, soon tempted the Spaniards to take permanent
possession. Seven years after the first exploration
a town was founded in latitude 27&deg;, midway
between the Andes and the Paran&aacute;. About
the same time other adventurers came pouring over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the Andes from northern Chile, and this current
soon joined that from the north. The Spaniards
established themselves as feudal lords, and the unhappy
Indians were divided among them. In one
district, forty-seven thousand Indians were divided
among fifty-six grantees. In 1553, Santiago de
Estero, for many years the capital of the province
of Tucuman was founded.</p>

<p>In 1561, the governor of Chile sent from Santiago
de Chile over the Andes an expedition which founded
the city of Mendoza in a most beautiful region,
where the vine flourishes in perfection, and where a
wonderful system of irrigation, inherited from the
Indians, still exists to attest the latters' engineering
skill. Next year San Juan was founded, and these
two towns were the centres for the settlement of the
province of Cuyo, which remained a part of Chile for
two hundred years. The immigrants from northern
Chile and Bolivia established Tucuman in the tropical
garden spot of the republic in 1565. From
Santiago del Estero, in 1573, an expedition was sent
two hundred and fifty miles to the south to a region
of fertile valleys and plains at the foot of a beautiful
mountain range. This was Cordoba, which at once
became, and has since remained, the most populous
of the interior provinces.</p>

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century the Spanish
power was firmly established in settlements that have
since become the Argentine provinces of Jujuy,
Salta, Tucuman, Catamarca, Santiago, Rioja, and
Cordoba. All these really formed a southern extension
of Upper Peru. Their geographical, political,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and commercial relations were with Charcas, Potos&iacute;,
and Lima. The discovery, in 1545, of the
great silver mines at Potos&iacute; at once made the high
Bolivian plateau, then known as the Audiencia of
Charcas, the most valuable and important province
of all the Spanish monarch's South American empire.
In 1571, the discovery of quicksilver mines in
Peru vastly increased the output of precious metals;
in 1575, the wonderful Oruro mines were opened,
and before the end of the century the copper-pan
amalgamation process was invented in Bolivia, revolutionising
the production of silver.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The resulting prosperity of the mining regions of
Bolivia stimulated the settlement of the north-western
provinces of the Argentine. The miners needed
provisions which could not well be raised in the
neighbourhood of Potos&iacute;. There was a demand for
cattle for beef, and for horses and mules for transportation.
A solid economic foundation was thus
provided for the plains settlements, and the enslavement
of the Indians and the breeding of cattle went
on apace. By the end of the sixteenth century
north-western Argentine&mdash;the province of Tucuman,
as it was then called&mdash;was the seat of many thriving
settlements whose Spanish inhabitants were mostly
pastoral. The Indians in the neighbourhood of
each settlement had been reduced to slavery, and
cultivated the fields that had been their fathers' for
the benefit of their white masters. The Spanish
proprietors lived like feudal lords, while the Spanish
authorities left these remote regions largely to their
own devices.</p>

<p>Conditions in Cuyo, the western province just
across the Andes from Santiago de Chile, were substantially
the same. A political dependency of
Chile, the few external relations it had were with
that captaincy-general. The Spanish grantees ruled
their Indian slaves in patriarchal fashion; agriculture
was the principal occupation; pastoral industry was
not so profitable as in Tucuman, and the region was
more isolated. In both Tucuman and Cuyo Spanish
rule was superimposed upon a previously existing
commercial and social structure. There was no
attempt to expel or destroy the aborigines.  On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the contrary, they were the sole labourers and their
exertions the chief source of the wealth of their conquerors.
There began a process of approximation
and mutual assimilation between the Spaniards and
their semi-civilised subjects. While the former continued
to be a privileged and ruling caste, the latter
absorbed much European knowledge from them.
The Indian language long held its own alongside of
the Spanish and is still spoken in many parts of the
region.</p>

<p>On the Atlantic side, among degraded peoples
who had not progressed beyond the wandering
and tribal stages of existence. Spanish settlement
proceeded on entirely different lines. There existed
no well-organised body politic, into whose
control the conquerors could step with hardly an interruption
to industry. Campaigns could not be
made with the confident expectation of finding
abundant accumulations of food <i>en route</i>. Expeditions
among the squalid tribes were slow and
dangerous and settlement stuck close to the rivers
instead of following fearlessly across the plateau to
the spots where the finest lands and the most flourishing
Indian communities lay ready for the spoiler.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the coast provinces were painful
and disastrous; the settlements were feeble;
centuries elapsed before the natural advantages of
the region were utilised, and before its accessibility
and fertility drew a great immigration. The assimilation
of Indian blood did not take place on a large
scale, and the immigrants and their descendants became
perforce horsemen and fighters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Discovery of the Plate.</i>&mdash;The Portuguese discovery
of the east coast of South America, in 1500, was a
disagreeable surprise to the Spanish government.
The Treaty of Tordesillas had been framed with the
purpose of giving America to Spain, while Africa
and the shores of the Indian Ocean were left to
Portugal. Nevertheless, the Portuguese vigorously
asserted their right to the prize they had picked up
by accident and insisted on the letter of the treaty.
They promptly explored the coast as far south as
Santa Catharina, six hundred miles north of the
Plate, but they had asserted no ownership farther
south at the date when the Spanish expeditions
began to be sent to the South Atlantic.</p>

<p>In 1516, a celebrated sea-captain from the north
of Spain&mdash;Juan Diaz de Solis&mdash;was sent out by
the Castilian government to explore the southern
part of the continent. He simply reconnoitred the
Brazilian coast, where the Portuguese had not yet
established any settlements, and, pressing on to the
south, finally reached the Plate. His first impression
on rounding Cape St. Maria, where the Uruguayan
shore turns to the north-west, was that he
had reached the southern point of the continent and
discovered the sea route into the Pacific. But the
freshness of the water in the great estuary undeceived
him. Following along the northern bank, he
landed with a small party and was attacked and
slain by a tribe of fierce and intractable Indians.</p>

<p>When the news reached Lisbon, the Portuguese
government protested against this invasion of territory,
which it claimed lay east of the Tordesillas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
line. Portugal, however, did not follow up her
protest or try to take possession for herself. At
this very time a celebrated Portuguese navigator,
Fernando Magellan, disgusted by the neglect of his
own country, was urging the Spanish government
to give him the means of carrying out his great project
for the circumnavigation of the globe. He was
confident he could reach the East Indies by rounding
the southern point of South America or by finding a
passage through the continent in higher latitudes
than had yet been reached. The year 1519, when
Magellan sailed from San Lucar on the first voyage
around the world, was big with fate for Spain.
Cortes was adding a new empire by the conquest of
Mexico, thus giving Spain control of the world's
supply of precious metals. The popular assemblies
of Castile and Aragon, of Catalonia, Valencia, and
Galicia, were preparing for a hopeless struggle
against the might of a monarch who ruled two-thirds
of Europe. At the very moment that Charles
V. was crushing Peninsular freedom by brutal military
force, the genius of Magellan and Cortes gave
him the whole of America. Spain had heretofore been
a federation of self-governing communes and provinces,
but their independence was now destroyed.
Military despotism proved strong enough to crush
liberty, although it was unable to stamp out the feeling
of local segregation. The very soldiers that conquered
America took over an instinctive feeling that
the central government was dangerous and inimical
to the people&mdash;a sentiment which has always survived
in some form among their descendants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Magellan stopped at the Plate in the beginning of
1520, and explored the estuary to make sure that it
did not afford the passage he was seeking. In
October he reached the mouth of the strait that
bears his name, and, wonderfully favoured by wind
and weather, threaded his way to the Pacific in five
weeks. Subsequent wayfarers were not so fortunate
and the strait never became a practicable commercial
route until after the introduction of steam navigation.
In the succeeding hundred years not half
a dozen ships reached the Pacific around South
America. Practically, the Pacific was accessible
only over the Isthmus or by the immensely long
journey around the Cape of Good Hope. Nevertheless,
the importance of this epoch-making voyage
has not been overestimated. The Pacific became,
in a sense, a Spanish lake, in which she could maintain
at will a naval preponderance. She occupied
the Philippines and secured control at leisure of the
Pacific coast of America. However, the scientific
results were more important. Thereafter, the thorough
exploration of all the shores of the South Sea
was only a question of time. Magellan's voyage
made geography an exact science. He sketched the
map of the world with broad and sure strokes and
left nothing for subsequent explorers except the
filling-in of details.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Philippines and Moluccas
gave rise to new disputes between Spain and Portugal
as to their rights under the Treaty of Tordesillas.
The imperfect instruments of those days left
the line doubtful on the eastern South American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
coast, as well as on the other side of the world. In
1526, Sebastian Cabot was sent by the Spanish
government to determine astronomically the location
of the line in America, and then to follow Magellan's
track to western Asia. At the mouth of the Plate
he heard rumours among the Indians of silver mines
on the river's banks and of the existence of a
great and wealthy empire at its headwaters. This
was Peru&mdash;not yet reached by the Castilians on
their way south from the Isthmus, but the coast
Indians showed Cabot silver ornaments which had
been passed from hand to hand from the highlands
of Peru and Bolivia down the river to the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Cabot and his band of adventurers determined to
neglect their surveying, trusting that the discovery
of silver mines would excuse their disobedience.
They spent three years in vain journeying and prospecting&mdash;exploring
the Uruguay to the head of
navigation and following up the Paran&aacute; as far as the
Apip&eacute; rapids. Signs of neither silver nor gold, nor
of civilised inhabitants, were found on either river.
Their upper courses came down from the east&mdash;the
direction opposite to that in which Eldorado was
reported. The gently flowing Paraguay, coming
down the plains in the centre of the continent,
seemed to offer a better hope of success. But
Cabot's forces and provisions were inadequate to
penetrating farther north than the present site of
Asuncion. Returning to a fort he had left on the
lower Paran&aacute;, he found that it had been taken by
Indians and its garrison massacred.  Discouraged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
by such a succession of difficulties and misfortunes,
he returned to Spain.</p>

<p>The news of Cabot's expedition, and its failure,
stimulated the Portuguese to undertake the colonisation
of the east coast of South America. Affonso
da Souza started from Lisbon with an expedition,
intending to take possession of the Plate. Lack of
provisions, fear of the Indians, the presence of a
Portuguese castaway&mdash;one of those insignificant
chances that sometimes change the course of empires
as a twig diverts the current of a river&mdash;stopped
Alfonso before he reached his destination.
Instead of establishing a colony on the estuary he
founded San Vicente, just south of the Tropic of
Capricorn. This became the southern outpost of
the Portuguese possessions, and the temperate zone
of South America was left open for the Spaniards to
occupy when they chose.</p>

<p>Two years after Cabot's failure, Pizarro overran
Peru. All Europe rang with the exploit. The
Spanish king was besieged by nobles who literally
begged the privilege of risking their lives and fortunes
in America. These "adelantados" contracted
to conquer, at their own charges, the particular districts
granted them, certain profits being reserved to
the crown, and Charles V. freely granted such
patents. Among the grantees was a Basque nobleman,
Pedro de Mendoza, to whom was given the
territory beginning at the Portuguese possessions
south two hundred leagues along the Atlantic coast
toward the Strait of Magellan. He raised more
than two thousand men and reached the Plate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
1535, where he immediately founded a city on the
south bank which he named Buenos Aires. He
intended to make it a base for an advance up the
Paran&aacute; to find and conquer another Peru. His attempt
was foredoomed to failure. The Indians
surrounding Buenos Aires were implacable in their
hatred of the invaders. They lived in scattered
little tribes, and neither would nor could furnish
food enough to maintain the Spaniards. The provisions
brought from Spain were inadequate; sorties
were useless; the Indians fled from large parties and
ambushed small ones. The preparations for the
advance up the river were delayed for months.
Hundreds died of hunger and disease. Within a
year the place had to be abandoned, and in a desperate
condition the expedition fled up the river to
Cabot's solid fort. Here the adelantado stopped,
sick and discouraged, while a few hundreds of the
more daring and persevering pressed on to the
north, determined to reach Eldorado. Arrived at
the junction of the Paraguay and Paran&aacute;, they chose
the former river, and pushed on up it as far as the
twentieth degree, to a place they called Candelaria.
There they found vast lakes and swamps spreading
to the west. It was necessary to protect their retreat
before plunging into the difficult country that
extends across to Bolivia. Accordingly, they divided
and one party remained on the dry ground
near the river, while two hundred desperate adventurers
pressed on through the wilderness, hoping to
reach the Bolivian plateau.</p>

<p>The party that stopped behind as a reserve was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
commanded by Domingo Irala, the real founder of
the Spanish settlements in the Paran&aacute; valley. The
main expedition never returned. Years afterward
friendly Indians brought back the tale that it had
reached the slopes of the Bolivian mountains, obtained
much gold and silver and started back
triumphantly, but had perished to the last man in
an Indian ambush not far from the Paraguay and
safety. Irala waited the appointed time and then
floated down the river. He and his companions
were well-nigh in despair. So far as they knew,
they were the only survivors of the three thousand
people who had accompanied Mendoza. To the
north the country was inhospitable and impenetrable,
and from their experiences of the year before
they knew that at the mouth of the river no provisions
or succour were to be had. On their way up
the river they had passed, about the twenty-fifth
degree, a beautiful and fertile rolling country, covered
with magnificent forests, with park-like openings,
and inhabited by a large and friendly Indian
population. Opposite the mouth of the Pilcomayo,
where there was a large Indian village, they stopped
on their downward journey, determined to settle
down and take some repose from their interminable
and fruitless wanderings in search of the will-o'-the-wisp
Eldorado. There, in 1536, they founded the
city of Asuncion, the first Spanish settlement on the
Atlantic slope of South America.</p>

<p><i>The Foundation of Buenos Aires.</i>&mdash;The failure of
Mendoza, first adelantado, to establish a colony on
the Plate, did not discourage others from soliciting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the grant of his territory. In 1540, Cabeza de
Vaca, a "conquistador" celebrated for his feats in
Florida, was appointed adelantado and set out gallantly
to find the second Peru, which everyone believed
to exist at the headwaters of the Paraguay.
Intent on reaching the interior as soon as possible,
he made no attempt to establish a town and port at
the mouth of the river Plate, but landed at Santa
Catharina on what is now the Brazilian coast in the
latitude of Paraguay, and set off across country with
four hundred men and twenty horses. The distance
was a thousand miles; the route led up a heavily
wooded mountain range on the coast, and thence
across a broken, but open, plateau, where great
rivers point out the natural routes to the Paran&aacute;.
The soil was fertile and the Indians along the road
were able to furnish considerable food supplies.
Cabeza de Vaca made the journey without appreciable
loss and arrived in Asuncion eager to
take command and dash across to the Andes.
But the sturdy Basques had selected their able
countryman&mdash;Domingo Irala&mdash;as chief of the
colony and gave the new adelantado a cold welcome.
Irala insisted that a reconnoitring expedition
be sent before risking the body of the Spaniards.
Its command was given him and he penetrated
almost to the headwaters of the Paraguay. Next
year Cabeza de Vaca followed, but as soon as he
left the Paraguay he got into difficulties. He could
not penetrate the swamps nor make headway against
the savage Indians who lived between the river and
the eastern slopes of the Cordillera. He returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
defeated and discouraged, and the people of Asuncion
bundled him back to Spain.</p>

<p>Though Irala subsequently did succeed in reaching
Peru, by the route up the Paraguay, no practical
results followed. Paraguay remained isolated from
the Spanish empire on the Pacific coast until a
roundabout communication was established down
the river and thence west across the dry and level
plains that stretch from the mouth of the river Plate
to the Cordillera.</p>

<p>The early days of the Asuncion settlement were
stormy. The rough adventurers fell to fighting
among themselves, and their cruelties often drove
the patient and submissive Indians into rebellion.
Their greed for bigger plantations and more slaves
pushed them on to conquering the aborigines in an
expanding circle. By 1553 they had founded a
settlement on the Upper Paran&aacute; and were dominant
from river to river in the southern half of the present
territory of Paraguay. Until his death, in 1557,
Irala was the dominating personality in the colony.
According to his lights he was just in his dealings
with the Indians. When he died the settlement
was firmly on its feet, and even the Indians revered
him as their benefactor. The mass of the population
was Indian, and Guarany has always remained the
prevalent language in Paraguay. Absolutely isolated
from the other European colonies, and almost
without communication with the mother country,
the settlement was, however, an unpromising affair.
The few hundreds of Spaniards might have sustained
their social and military superiority over the hordes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Indians by whom they were surrounded, but, without
material and intellectual communication with
Spain, they could achieve no commercial success.</p>

</div>

<p>An outlet to the sea was necessary. The original
settlers had been adventurers, willing to follow Mendoza
through swamp and forest up to the walls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Eldorado, and their children were not less enterprising.
The horses brought over by the adelantados
had multiplied amazingly, and were spreading
wild over the pampa to the south. Cattle, sheep,
and goats bred by millions. Before long the attractions
of a pastoral life began to appeal to the
Spaniards and creoles of Asuncion. The braver
and more energetic preferred the free open existence
of the pampa to idleness in the sleepy villages of
Paraguay.</p>

<p>The Argentine nation proper began its existence
when the creole mounted his horse and took to
cattle-breeding on the plains. The possession of
horses, as much as of firearms, gave the gaucho his
military predominance over the fiercest aborigines,
and the horse was also the cornerstone of his industrial
system. The cattle of the open pampa gave
him an unlimited supply of the best food, and his
horses enabled him to procure it with a minimum of
effort. Irala's successors repeatedly tried to establish
a colony near the mouth of the Plate, but they
were not successful until the creoles on horseback had
pushed their way south along the pampa and driven
back or subdued the wandering Indians. In 1560,
the Guaranies of Paraguay were definitely crushed
in the horribly bloody battle of Acari, but it was
not until 1573 that the Spaniards from Asuncion
succeeded in founding a city south of the confluence
of the Paran&aacute; and Paraguay. Santa F&eacute; was the first
Spanish settlement on the Plate in territory now a
part of the Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>The man who led the creoles to the pampa was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Juan de Garay, a Basque, who had been one of the
soldiers in the army that conquered Peru. His
energy and vigour, and the bravery of the creole
cavalry who followed his expeditions down the river
and over the pampas, at length opened up communication
from Paraguay to Europe and gave Spain a
seaport on the South Atlantic. Curiously enough,
in the very year that Garay founded Santa F&eacute;, the
Spaniards from Peru founded Cordoba&mdash;the most
eastward of the Andean settlements. Their hard
riders had pushed on from Cordoba, reconnoitring
as far as the Paran&aacute; and there ran across Garay's
men. The two currents of Argentine settlements
met almost at the beginning, though two centuries
were to elapse before they completely coalesced.</p>

<p>Eight years later, Garay succeeded in founding
Buenos Aires after Zarate, the third adelantado,
had failed as badly as any of his predecessors.
Garay, by sheer force of energy and fitness, became
the real ruler of the settlements. Active, far-sighted,
and able, he perceived that a purely military establishment
at the mouth of the river was foredoomed
to failure. To be permanent, the port and town
must be self-sustaining, and therefore must be surrounded
by farms and ranches and be accessible by
land from the upper settlements. In the spring of
1580, the acting governor sent overland from Santa
F&eacute; two hundred families of Guarany Indians, accompanied
by a thousand horses, two hundred cows, and
fifty sheep, besides mares, carts, oxen, and other
necessaries. The soldiers of the convoy were
mostly creoles born in Paraguay.  Boats carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
down from Santa F&eacute; arms, munitions, seed grain,
tools, and whatever in those rude days was essential
to a settlement. He, himself, went by land with
forty soldiers, following the highland that skirts the
west bank of the Paran&aacute; from Santa F&eacute; to Buenos
Aires.</p>

<p>The Plate estuary affords no proper harbours; the
immense volume of water spreading over vast shallow
beds chokes it with sand-bars, and the shores are
so shelving that even small boats cannot approach
the land. The north side is bolder, and at Montevideo
and at the mouth of the Uruguay affords bays
partly sheltered from the storms which sweep up over
the level pampas and make anchorage in the river so
unsafe. But the north bank was cut off from land
communication with the existing Spanish towns by
the mighty Uruguay and Paran&aacute;, and Garay desired
that his new city should be always accessible from
his older settlements on the right bank of the Paran&aacute;.
His choice of the particular spot where the largest
city of the southern hemisphere has since grown up,
seems to have been determined by a few trifling circumstances.
He kept as near the head of the estuary
as possible, in order to shorten the land route
from Santa F&eacute;, and picked upon a slight rise of
ground between two draws, which made the site
defensible. The fact that a nearby creek&mdash;the
Riachuelo&mdash;afforded a shelter for little boats, may
also have been given weight in reaching a decision.</p>

<p>Though his settlers did not number five hundred,
Garay laid out his city like a town-site boomer.
The surrounding country was divided into ranches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and the neighbouring Indians were distributed
among the citizens of the new town. A "Cabildo," or
city council, was named, with the full paraphernalia
of a Spanish municipal government. The new town
started off in the full enjoyment of all the guarantees
known to immemorial Spanish constitutional law.
Troubles broke out almost immediately between the
creole settlers and the Spaniards who had been sent
over by the adelantado to fill offices and get the best
things in distributions of land and slaves. Garay
had hardly left the town to look after the rest of the
province than the creoles, indignant over unfair
treatment, forcibly demanded an open Cabildo.
This was an extraordinary popular assembly which,
according to old Spanish custom, might be called at
critical times, and was something like a town meeting.
In theory, the property-owners and educated
citizens were called together merely to give advice,
but in practice, it was a tumultuous assemblage to
overawe the office-holders. The Argentine creoles
were doing nothing more than asserting their constitutional
rights as vassals of the king of Castile.
They compelled the Spanish office-holders to compromise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Garay was clinching his claim to immortality
as the founder of the Spanish power on
the Plate. He explored the pampas to the south
and west of the new city, and reduced many of the
tribes to slavery or vassalage. He found the plains
already overrun with hundreds of thousands of
horses&mdash;the descendants of the few abandoned there
forty-five years before when the remnants of Men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>doza's
ill-starred expedition fled up the river. On
his way back to Santa F&eacute; this great Indian fighter
was ambushed by Indians and stabbed while he
slept.</p>

<p>His death was followed by outbreaks among the
creoles, who resented the efforts of the adelantado's
new representatives to establish a monopoly in
horse-hair. Scarcely had they found a way to make
a little money, by hunting wild horses for their hair,
than the officials tried to absorb all the profit. The
struggle between the repressive commercial policy
of Spain, and the interests of the Plate colonists,
began with the foundation of the colony of Buenos
Aires and went on for more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>In 1588, the creoles obtained a foothold in the extreme
north of the mesopotamian region by founding
the city of Corrientes near the junction of the Paran&aacute;
and Paraguay. All the new commonwealths south
of Asuncion obtained a solid economic foundation in
the herds of cattle and horses which covered the
plains. In the regions adjacent to the Andes the
Spaniards did not become so exclusively pastoral as
their brethren of the pampas near the Plate. While
they had more and better Indian slaves, their pasturage
was not so good. Though apparently more
isolated, their proximity to Upper Peru and the
trade that went on with that great mining country&mdash;the
goal of fortune-hunting Spaniards in those
years&mdash;placed them more directly under the control
of the viceregal authorities. Tucuman was a mere
southern extension of the jurisdiction of the Audiencia
at Charcas, and Cuyo was an integral part of Chile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
but this did not prevent the early development of a
strong sentiment in favour of local self-government
and of hatred of the imported Spanish satraps.</p>

<p>By the year 1617 the settlements on the Lower
Paran&aacute; had become of considerable importance.
Buenos Aires was a town of three thousand people;
the right bank of the river as far as Santa F&eacute; was a
grazing-ground for the herds of the creoles; towns
and ranches were flourishing in Corrientes. In that
year the Spanish crown abolished the office of adelantado
and erected the lower settlements into a
province separate from Paraguay. The new province
included the territory that is now Uruguay,
as well as the four actual Argentine provinces of
Buenos Aires, Santa F&eacute;, Entre Rios and Corrientes.
Entre Rios and Uruguay were, however, as yet
entirely unsettled.</p>

<p>While the creoles were thus firmly establishing
themselves along the Lower Paran&aacute; and in the Andean
provinces, the Jesuits were converting the
Indians in the east of Paraguay, and early in the
seventeenth century these indefatigable missionaries
had penetrated to the Upper Paran&aacute;, crossed it, and
were gathering the Indians by thousands into peaceful
villages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE ARGENTINE LAND</h3>


<p>South from where the great mass of the Bolivian
Andes shoves a shoulder to the east, as if
seeking to join the Brazilian mountain system, and
from where a low ridge stretches out to form the
watershed between the Madeira and the eastward-flowing
affluents of the Paraguay, extends an immense
flat plain. Two thousand miles from north
to south, and nearly five hundred miles in breadth,
hardly a hillock rises above its surface from the
foothills of the Andes westward to the sea. In the
tropical North its surface is partly covered with
trees, but south of the Chaco the only woodlands
are narrow belts following the streams. Everywhere
stretch the grassy plains, without an obstruction or
interruption. The soil is a fine alluvium, full of the
right chemical elements, and admirably adapted to
agriculture, wherever the rainfall is sufficient. As
a pasture-ground it is the finest on the planet.
Within recent geological times this plain was the
bottom of a great shallow gulf which received the
detritus washed down from the Andes on the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
side and the Brazilian mountains on the other. The
gradual uplifting of those youngest mountains&mdash;the
Andes&mdash;raised their flanks until the adjacent
floor of the gulf appeared dry land, a land all ready
and prepared for human occupancy. Nowhere does
man encounter fewer obstacles to his freedom of
movement or find it easier to procure his food supply
than on the pampa&mdash;the characteristic topographical
feature of the political division of South America
known as Argentina.</p>

<p>Skirting the ridge on the east and draining the
vast slopes of the Brazilian mountains of their tropical
rainfall, is the great river Paran&aacute;. In latitude
27&deg; it turns abruptly to the west, as if about to cross
the pampa, but a hundred miles farther on it resumes
its southward course. At this last turn the
Paran&aacute; flows into a river which comes straight
down from the north, draining the bed of the old
inland sea that used to divide South America. This
junction of the Paran&aacute; and the Paraguay forms the
second largest river in the world&mdash;a river without
obstructions to navigation, but which is so immense
that it cannot be bridged. In latitude 32&deg; it turns
back to the south-east, soon receives the Uruguay,&mdash;a
swifter stream, that drains the southern part of the
Atlantic highlands,&mdash;and then opens out into the
great shallow estuary known as the River Plate.
Between the Uruguay and the Paran&aacute; is the Argentine
Mesopotamia,&mdash;a flat region where the low-lying
plains, covered with luscious grasses, intersected with
streams, and interspersed with timber, gradually rise
up-stream into the highlands of the Missions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>To the west the pampa is bounded by the foothills
of the Andes and the parallel chains with which
that great mountain system reinforces its flanks.
At the Bolivian frontier, the great outward-jutting
shoulder of the Andes looms up among a series of
subordinate chains. South of them, for a thousand
miles, is a belt of broken country averaging two
hundred miles in width. The pampa creeps up to
the very foot of the mountain ranges and where it
is watered blossoms like a garden. A quarter of the
population of the Republic lives in the irrigated
valleys of these Andean provinces.</p>

<p>A comparatively narrow, arid, belt stretches diagonally
across the South American continent from the
Pacific, in Northern Chile, to the Atlantic in Northern
Patagonia. Consequently, from north to south,
and from the Atlantic back toward the north-east
border of this arid belt, the rainfall of Argentina decreases.
On the north-eastern frontier it is about 80
inches a year; at Rosario, 40; at Cordoba, 30; at
Buenos Aires, 35. In the Andean provinces it decreases
from over forty, near the Bolivian frontier,
to five or six at San Juan in the latitude of Santa F&eacute;
and Cordoba. In the eastern part of the great
pampa the rainfall is ample for cereal crops; in the
western half the rains are periodical and the region
is better adapted to grazing than to agriculture, and
there the grass lands are intersected with tracts of
desert which grow larger towards the south. In the
Andes the eastern ranges, catching the rain-laden
upper currents, send down ample water to irrigate
the valleys and adjacent plains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The mesopotamian region and the country directly
south of the Plate estuary have, of course, an ample
rainfall. South of the latitude of Buenos Aires the
rainfall of the Andean region, which has grown
steadily less from the northern boundary, begins
again to increase. The eastern slopes of the mountains
south for an indeterminate distance are well
watered, while the Patagonian plains to their east
are dry and desolate.</p>

<p>The climate varies from tropical, on the northern
frontier, to arctic in Tierra del Fuego. The southern
pampa and the Andean provinces are temperate or
subtropical, and admirably adapted for habitation
by men of European descent. Tucuman is the hottest
of these provinces. There the average temperature
of the coldest month is 53&deg;; at Buenos Aires
it is 50&deg;; at Cordoba 47&deg;. The average temperatures
in these localities for the whole year are, respectively,
63&deg;, 61&deg;, and 63&deg;.</p>

<p>When Columbus landed in the West Indies, this
vast territory was occupied by two separate sets of
aborigines. The Andean provinces were a part of
the great Inca Empire. South as far as Mendoza,
the Andean valleys were filled with a vigorous yet
peaceful population who had brought the art of
irrigation to a high degree of perfection. Plantations
of corn, mandioc, and potatoes flourished on
the terraced hillsides and in the fertile valleys. The
lower and hotter plains furnished cotton. Constant
communication, both commercial and governmental,
was kept up with the centre of the Inca power in
Cuzco, along roads that followed the easiest routes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
along the valleys and up over the passes to the
Bolivian plateau, and thence to the central provinces
of the Empire. Chile, on the other side of the Cordillera,
was a sister province, and the passes over the
great range were well known and constantly used.
The population was greater than it is at the present
day. While the political solidity of the Inca Empire
is doubtless exaggerated, it is certain that the same
civilisation extended from Ecuador to Mendoza and
Santiago de Chile, and that the Cordilleran region
was the home of twenty millions of people, organised
into vigorous, progressive, and expanding communities.</p>

<p>The Andean civilisation never showed any tendency
to expand over the tropical plains of the great
central depressions. The Incas themselves never
cared to penetrate far down the wooded and steaming
slopes of the Andes lying directly to the east of
their own capital. Their dependent states bordering
on the Argentine pampa did not cross the desert
plains, where irrigating ditches could not reach. So
far as we now know, the Andean Indians had never
penetrated to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>East of the pampas, in the hilly woods of Paraguay
and Brazil, tribes vastly inferior in intelligence, political
organisation, and civilisation, maintained a precarious
existence. Many of those who belonged to
the great Guarany family lived in palisaded villages
and cultivated the soil, but none had advanced far
on the road toward a reasonably efficient social and
military organisation. The procuring of food for
their daily wants was their chief occupation; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
tribes were too small to make effective warfare on a
large scale; there was no prospect of any development
into a higher culture. Certain tribes, inferior
to the Guaranies, had spread from the wooded
regions over the mesopotamian provinces and into
the adjacent pampa, and the districts on both sides
of the estuary, but they never ventured far from the
water-supply. Though brave and intractable, these
people showed no real fighting capacity until after
white men had taught them the use of horses.
With this knowledge, however, they were able to
offer a very effective resistance, which was not completely
overcome until twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The area of the whole Republic is 1,212,600 square
miles. The mesopotamian region contains 81,000
square miles, being larger than England and even
more uniformly fertile. The pampa suitable for
grain production, including the semi-forested Chaco
plain in the north, has an area of not less than 350,000
square miles. The Andean provinces contain
nearly 300,000, and Patagonia 316,000. The grazing
pampa is partly included in the Andean provinces;
its boundaries to the south and toward the Atlantic
are not capable of exact definition, but it includes
perhaps half the territory of the Republic. Except
the higher mountains, and the so-called deserts of
the centre, the whole territory is productive.</p>

<p>The description of the white man's spread over
this immense country&mdash;the largest, except Brazil, of
the South American states, and of all these the most
immediately and unquestionably suitable for maintaining
a large population of European blood&mdash;is
tedious when told in detail. But it is a story fraught
with significance for the future of the world. On
the plains of Argentina the descendants of the Spanish
conquerors have fought out among themselves
all the perplexing questions arising from the adaptation
of Spanish absolutism and ancient burgh law to
a new country and to personal freedom. After more
than half a century of civil war, constitutional equilibrium
has been attained. The country ought to
be interesting where there has grown up within a
few decades the largest city in the Southern Hemisphere,
and the largest Latin city, except Paris, in
the world. The growth of Buenos Aires has been as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
dizzying as that of Chicago, and the world has never
seen a more rapid and easy multiplication of wealth
than that which took place in Argentina between the
years of 1870 and 1890. Interesting, too, is Argentina
as the scene of the most extensive experiment
in the mixture of races now going on anywhere in
the world except in the United States. In forty
years more than two millions of immigrants have
made their homes in Argentina. The majority are
from Southern Europe, but the proportion of British,
Germans, French, Belgians, and Swiss is a fifth
of the whole. Will the Northerners be assimilated
and disappear in the mass of Southerners, or will
they succeed in impressing their characteristics on
the latter? Will a mixed race be evolved especially
suited to success in subtropical America? Will the
system of administration painfully evolved out of
the old Spanish laws prove permanently suited to the
great industrial and commercial state that is growing
up on the Argentine pampa? Will the municipal
and bureaucratic system prove adaptable and elastic
enough to furnish a political framework for the tremendous
economic development which has already
made such strides, but which really has only begun?
Will the intellectual and social ideals of the coming
Argentine nation be military, bureaucratic, leisurely,
or will they be purely commercial? Certain answers
to these questions cannot yet be deduced from the
data furnished by the history of Argentina. Their
solution, however, inheres in the past of its people.
The future of Argentina will have a profound influence
on the rest of the continent. It has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
largest territory except Brazil, the greatest per capita
wealth, its population is increasing most rapidly, and
it has received the greatest amount of foreign capital.
Immigration and investment in the other countries
may be expected soon to begin on a large scale.
The experience of Argentina promises to prove invaluable
to all of South America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE SPANISH COLONIAL SYSTEM</h3>


<p>Spain, as a world-power, reached her apogee in
the year 1580, when Juan de Garay founded
Buenos Aires. In that year Portugal was united to
the Spanish Crown, and the East Indies and Brazil
doubled Spain's colonial dominions. But at the
very same moment the first symptom of her decline
appeared. For the first time it was proved to the
world that she could not hold the seas against her
young rivals from Northern Europe. Sir Francis
Drake, the earliest harbinger of Britain's dominance
on the seas, appeared off the Plate on his way to the
Pacific. Spain had trusted that the difficulty of
threading the Straits of Magellan would protect the
South Sea, but Drake slipped through in a spell of
favourable weather and found few Spanish ships
which were fit to fight him along all the coast to
Panama. Drake's wonderful raid humbled Spanish
pride where Spain was thought strongest, and encouraged
Englishmen to fight with a good heart,
a few years later, the overwhelming Invincible
Armada.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1616 a great Dutchman, Schouten, found the
passage into the Pacific around Cape Horn. This
discovery revolutionised the navigation routes of the
world. Heretofore the only practicable commercial
route to the Pacific had been across the Atlantic to
the north shore of the Isthmus. Nombre de Dios
was the metropolis and the market where all the
goods for South America were landed. Those intended
to be sold on the shore of the Caribbean
were sent along its coast, and those intended for the
Pacific were carried overland to Panama to be
shipped on coasters down to their destination. Direct
communication across the Atlantic to Buenos
Aires was forbidden by the Spanish government.</p>

<p>Schouten's epoch-making discovery opened up
the way for countless Dutch and English ships to
ply a contraband trade with the towns of the Pacific
coast, but did not induce the Spanish government
to change its time-honoured policy or vary its trade
routes. America was treated as the private property
of the sovereign of Castile, and its commerce
was to be exploited for his sole benefit. No Spaniard
was allowed to freight a ship for the colonies,
or to buy a pound of goods thence, without obtaining
a special permission and paying for that privilege.
Cadiz was the only port in Spain from which ships
were permitted to sail for America, and the whole
trade was farmed out to a ring of Cadiz merchants.
To protect this monopoly and to prevent the export
of gold and silver were the chief purposes of the
Spanish colonial policy. Every port on the seaboard
of Spanish South America was closed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
trans-oceanic traffic, except Nombre de Dios on the
north shore of the Isthmus. The towns on the
Pacific and Caribbean coasts might admit coasting
vessels properly identified as coming from the Isthmus
and loaded with the consignments of the Cadiz
monopolists, but the South Atlantic ports were
absolutely closed so far as law could close them.
Legally, no ships whatever, coasters or ocean carriers,
could enter and unload at Buenos Aires. Her
imports from Spain must first go to the Isthmus, be
disembarked, and then transported across the mule-paths
to the Pacific. Thence the goods had to go in
coasters to Callao, in Peru, where they were again
disembarked, transported up the Andean passes
along the Bolivian plateau, and finally down into
the Argentine plain. Under such conditions in the
southern provinces European manufactures could
only be sold at fabulous prices.</p>

<p>On the other hand, such a system made exports
impossible, except those of precious metals and
valuable drugs. Hides, hair, wool, agricultural products,
would not stand the cost of such long transport
by land and sea. The Spanish authorities seem
deliberately to have come to the conclusion that
America should be confined to producing gold and
silver, and they ruthlessly strangled all other industries.
The Plate settlements especially suffered
from the ruinous consequences of this system.
Having no mines of precious metals, they were
considered worthless; their interests were ignored,
and their complaints given no attention. The mere
existence of Buenos Aires was a source of anxiety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to the monopolists and to the Spanish government.
They feared that the English or Dutch might take
possession of the mouth of the Plate and thence
send expeditions to intercept gold and silver shipments
along the overland routes. More immediate
and real was the danger of the establishment of a
contraband trade which would deprive the Cadiz
merchants of their enormous profits on goods sent
by the Isthmian route.</p>

<p>The home government enacted laws of incredible
severity in trying to enforce this policy. In 1599
the governor of Buenos Aires was instructed to forbid
all importation and exportation under penalty of
death and forfeiture of property. The shipping of
hides and horsehair to Spain would seem to be
harmless enough, but the Spanish government
dreaded that gold and silver might be smuggled out
in the packages. The government would lose its
royal fifth and the precious metals might be sent to
Spain's rivals and enemies in Europe. According
to the economic ideas then accepted, gold and silver
alone constituted wealth, and every ounce mined in
America which did not reach Spain's coffers was
considered irretrievably lost. To prevent clandestine
shipments of the precious metals all commercial
intercourse from the coast to the interior was made
illegal, and no goods whatever were permitted to
pass along the road between Buenos Aires and
Cordoba.</p>

<p>In the very nature of things such laws were unenforcible.
Even the governors sent out for the
special purpose of repressing evasions recommended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
modifications. But the Cadiz monopolists were
stubborn and their influence with the Court was all-powerful.
The laws remained on the statute books
only to be constantly disregarded. No human
power could keep people who lived on the seashore,
and who had hides, wool, and horsehair to sell, from
exchanging them for clothing and tools. Perforce
Buenos Aires became a community of smugglers.
English and Dutch ships surreptitiously landed their
cargoes of manufactures and took their pay in hides
or in silver dollars that had escaped the Spanish
soldiers on the road down from Potos&iacute;.</p>

<p>Rio and Santos, in Brazil, became intermediate
warehouses for the commerce of the Plate. The
officials in Buenos Aires itself connived at evasions,
and the very governors made great fortunes in partnership
with smugglers. The guards along the interior
routes shut their eyes when the mule trains
passed, and the goods of Flanders and France
reached Cordoba, Santiago, Potos&iacute;, and even Lima,
by way of Buenos Aires, and were sold at prices with
which the Cadiz monopolists could not compete.
Silver came surreptitiously from Chile and Bolivia
to pay for these goods. The net result was that
trade followed its natural and easiest route, although
there was a fearful waste of energy in the process.
The bribe-taking official, the idle soldier at the road
station, the smuggler handling his goods in small
boats and risking his life at night, and the numerous
middle men absorbed what might have been legitimate
profit to the seller or to the consumer. Commerce
was half strangled, and with it the industries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the Spanish colonies. Civil government itself
suffered, for a community whose daily occupation it
was to break one law could not be expected to have
much respect for other laws, nor for the bribe-taking
rulers and mulish legislators.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, against these outrageously unreasonable
regulations the colonists for centuries made no
armed protest. They never questioned the abstract
right of the Crown to forbid them to sell what the
labour of their hands had produced. They evaded
but did not contest. Centuries of this sort of thing
ingrained into South Americans the belief that industrial
and commercial activity exists only by sufferance
of the government. The right to sell, to
buy, to exercise a profession or a trade, depended
on the permission of the government. The people
saw the executives taxing industry at their pleasure,
and suppressing its very beginnings, until such a
procedure came to seem a matter of course. Commercial
spirit was constantly hampered and business
skill deprived of its rewards. The evil effects of
such a policy can be seen at every step of the development
of the Spanish-American countries. It
is no wonder that office-holding became the most
popular of avocations. The farmer, the stock-raiser,
and the merchant seemed to be allowed to exist only
to pay the Spanish functionary, instead of the government's
existing for the benefit of the producing
community. To this day, service with the government
is more esteemed than commercial pursuits.
The national ideals are only slowly becoming industrial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The King of Castile was absolute sovereign and
sole proprietor of America. The continent was an
appanage of his crown; it did not form an integral
part of Spain; America and Spain were connected
solely through their common allegiance to him.
The King governed America directly, assisted not
by his regular ministers, but by a body of personal
advisers called the Council of the Indies. His representatives
in South America were the Viceroys
of Mexico and Peru. The latter's jurisdiction extended
over all South America. Certain great territorial
divisions had been made Captaincies-General,
and though theoretically subordinate to the Viceroy,
they were in effect independent of him. In the great
capital cities sat bodies of high judicial and executive
officials known as Audiencias. Among their
functions was that of exercising the powers of the
Viceroy during his absence. Charcas, the capital of
the mining region of Bolivia, was the seat of an
Audiencia, and since this city had no resident Viceroy
or Captain-General its Audiencia was the real
supreme authority over the Argentine and all the
territory east of the Cordillera, from Lake Titicaca
to the Straits.</p>

<p>Viceroyalties and Captaincies-General were divided
into provinces, each of which was ruled by a
royal governor. When the Spaniards permanently
occupied a new region their first step was to found
a city and organise a municipal government. Like
the Romans, they knew no other unit of political
structure. The governing body was called a Cabildo
and consisted of from six to twelve members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
who held office for life. It conducted the ordinary
judicial and civil administration through officers
selected by itself and from its own members.
Though the governor was <i>ex-officio</i> president of
this body, and although its members had bought
their places, they were not mere figureheads to
register his will. Limited though their functions
were, they represented the time-honoured governmental
form into which Spaniards had always
crystallised, and the Creoles could not be prevented
from obtaining a preponderant influence in
them. Throughout colonial times they represented
local and Creole interests and operated continually
as a check to the aggression of the military governors.</p>

<p>The territorial jurisdiction of a municipality was
usually ill-defined. Indeed, as a rule, in the days
of settlement it extended in every direction until
the claim of another city was encountered, and the
terms "city" and "province," were, therefore, usually
synonymous. As population grew denser new
cities were founded which as municipalities were
independent of the capital town, but they were
not necessarily separated from the original province.
The Cabildo of the capital of a province bore a
peculiar relation to the royal governor, and often
tried to exercise a control over the affairs of the
whole province, deeming themselves his associates
and the sharers of the functions he exercised, outside
of its own boundaries, as well as within them.
This assumption was favoured by the fact that no
general body representing all the cities of a province<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
existed, nor any constitutional machinery by which
they could act in common.</p>

<p>Spanish-Americans have known only two forms of
government, which have everywhere and always co-existed,
though they seem inconsistent. First, there
is an executive&mdash;the limits of his power ill-defined,
and often imposing his will by force, in essence
arbitrary and personal, and feared rather than respected
by the people; secondly, the Cabildos and
the modern deliberative bodies. Never really elective,
these have nevertheless performed many of the
functions of bodies truly representative; they have
checked the arbitrary executives and furnished a
basis for government by discussion. For centuries
the communities looked to them for the conduct of
ordinary local governmental affairs, and they survived
all the storms of colonial and revolutionary
times. On the other hand, their importance in the
Spanish governmental scheme has been a most potent
influence in preventing the growth of local representative
government by elective assemblies and
officials. Consequently, in national matters, freely
elected and truly representative assemblies have
been hard to obtain. Legislation has been controlled
by the functionaries, and there has been no
general and continuous participation in governmental
affairs by the body of the people. Government
by discussion and by the common-sense of the
majority is difficult to establish among a people accustomed
for centuries to seeing matters in the
hands of officials whom they had no practical means
of holding to responsibility. The people have rarely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
felt that the executive was their own officer. He
was imposed on them from above, he was not amenable
to them, and so far as they were concerned he
ruled at his own risk. The Creoles were intensely
democratic in feeling and hard to control, and when
they could not tolerate an executive they turned him
out by force, because no effective machinery existed
by which they could turn him out peaceably.</p>

<p>Though the colonial governor was required to give
an account of his administration at the close of his
term, as a matter of fact he was an irresponsible and
despotic satrap, who taxed, judged, and imprisoned
people at his pleasure, restrained only by his traditional
respect for the Cabildos and by the fear of
exciting revolt. He commanded the armed forces,
and his power was, in fact, rather military than civil
in origin, method, and application. The Cabildos
selected the ordinary judicial officers of first resort
from among their own members' list, but their
authority was not very effective outside the town
itself. The vast plains between the settlements
were largely governed patriarchally by the ranch
owners and the popular and capable gauchos who
grew into leaders.</p>

<p>A taste for town life soon became characteristic
of the Spanish-Americans, and wherever able they
crowded into the towns in preference to staying on
their ranches. Wealth, intelligence, and political
activity, therefore, came to be concentrated in a few
<i>foci</i>. The system of granting immense tracts of
land and dividing up the Indians as slaves among
the proprietors would apparently have a tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to produce a landed aristocracy. But the money
profits in colonial days were small, and the great
landowner lived in the same style as his poorer
neighbour. Titles of nobility did not exist, and the
constitution of society was decidedly democratic.
From the very earliest times no love was lost between
the Creoles and the newly arrived Spaniards.
The governor was almost invariably a Spaniard,
while the Cabildo and its officers were usually
Creoles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>


<p>The greatest name in the history of Buenos
Aires during the early years of the seventeenth
century is that of Hernandarias Saavedra. Of distinguished
ancestry and pure Spanish blood, he was
born at Asuncion in 1561. A thorough Creole, his
education was confined to the instruction he received
at the convent of the Franciscan Fathers in
his native town. At fifteen he left school and joined
an expedition against the Indians of the Andes.
He showed remarkable capacity in fighting on the
plains, and his shrewdness and firmness in dealing
with the aborigines were even more valuable than
his courage. Juan de Garay, the far-sighted Basque
who founded Buenos Aires, was the patron, model,
and hero of young Hernandarias, who followed him
in his great expedition over the southern pampa.
When Garay, the great Indian fighter and coloniser,
perished, his mantle fell on the young man's shoulders.
In 1588 Hernandarias distinguished himself
in the defence of Corrientes against the Indians of
Chaco and was the leader in the difficult campaigns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
undertaken in retaliation. By the time he had
reached thirty he was the leading Creole in all the
vast region from the Upper Paraguay down to
Buenos Aires, and when the Spanish Lieutenant-General
of Asuncion was deposed an open Cabildo
called him to the vacancy.</p>

<p>Eleven years later (1602) the governor of Buenos
Aires died, and by common consent Hernandarias
filled the office <i>ad interim</i>. This popular selection
was soon confirmed by royal commission. He
signalised his term of office by an expedition down
the coast in which he carried the terror of the
white man's arms to the limits of the continent,
and defeated the Indians wherever they resisted.
Severe with the Indians when occasion demanded,
he was inflexibly just, and as a rule protected them
against the unlawful aggressions of his countrymen.
Though he did so much to curb their military
power, he left behind him the name of being their
best friend. He manumitted his own slaves; he opposed
the extension of the system of "encomiendas"
with its enslavement of wild Indians, and after his
first term as governor of Buenos Aires he was named
official protector of the aborigines.</p>

<p>Although a Creole, such was his ability as a military
leader, and his shrewdness, wisdom, and firmness
as a civil ruler, that the Spanish government
could not ignore him. Though a governor was soon
sent out from Spain to replace him and fatten off
the provincials, Hernandarias remained the most
powerful man in the colony. The Spanish authorities
found that they needed him, and he retained their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
confidence as well as that of the Creoles. He wisely
advised the latter against open opposition, believing
that continued peace must make the colony so
strong that its interests could not continue to be
ignored. In 1610 the Spanish government promulgated
laws forbidding the further enslavement of
Indians, and Hernandarias did much to secure their
enforcement. At the same time he encouraged the
Jesuits to extend their missions over the upper valley
of the Uruguay, while he secured the ranchers
of the western plains against the encroachments of
these energetic priests. The Creoles prospered in
the pastoral pursuits on the pampas, while the
Jesuits developed the more purely agricultural
resources of the wooded hills in the east. The success
of his policy soon became evident in the increasing
prosperity of the colony. Three hundred
thousand hides were smuggled out of Buenos Aires
in British ships alone in the year 1658, and by 1630
the Jesuit missions extended in a broad, continuous
belt along the Paran&aacute; and the Uruguay from the
Tropic of Capricorn to the thirtieth degree. They
were the rulers of a great theocratic republic, whose
area could not have been less than 150,000 square
miles, and whose population of something like a
million was concentrated in thriving and peaceful
villages. The Jesuits systematically studied the
resources of the country and taught their Indians
the cultivation of many crops suitable for export.
Their territory was commercially tributary to Buenos
Aires and contributed to her growth and prosperity.</p>

<p>When the governorship of Buenos Aires again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
became vacant in 1615, by the death of the Spanish
incumbent, Hernandarias entered on his own third
term, and two years later, by his advice, the rapidly
growing province was divided. Paraguay became a
separate province, and the new province of Buenos
Aires included all the territory east of Tucuman and
south and east of Paraguay. The three provinces
of Paraguay, Buenos Aires, and Tucuman were
administratively separate, and each was directly
dependent upon the Audiencia at Charcas and the
Viceroy at Lima. One immediate purpose of the
Spanish government, in erecting Buenos Aires into
an independent province, was the enforcement of
the prohibition of trade. It was thought that a
governor always on the ground, and concentrating
his attention on the subject, would be efficient in
that direction. However, the result was the opposite
of that expected. No governor of Buenos Aires
could avoid making the interests of his capital city
his own. If honest, he was constantly pressing the
home government to open the doors a little and to
make exceptions of particular cases; if dishonest, he
went into partnership with the traders.</p>

<p>Hernandarias's career is the one striking example
of success by a Creole in colonial times. Though
the conquest and settlement of South America was
accomplished by individual initiative, the men who
had done the pioneering, who had fought and journeyed
and suffered, who had stained their souls with
horrible cruelties, whose adventures and successes
would not be credited if the physical evidences did
not prove the truth of the chronicles, were displaced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
with scant ceremony to make room for impoverished
Court favourites. If the original conquerors were
thus badly treated, the Creoles, unfortunate to have
missed the inestimable advantage of being born on
Castilian soil, could not look for favour, or equal
treatment with the office-holders sent out from
Madrid year after year.</p>

<p>The story of the provinces that now form the territory
of the Argentine Republic has not great interest
during the long years that intervene from the
completion of the romantic conquest until the uprising
against Spanish authority. With the end of
the sixteenth century, the spirit of enterprise among
both Spaniards and Creoles diminished. Throughout
the seventeenth century little progress was made
in extirpating the savage Indians even in regions as
close to Buenos Aires as Entre Rios and Uruguay.
Settlements were confined to the right bank of the
Paran&aacute;, and the Indians on the left bank, protected
behind the wide flood of that river's delta, were left
undisturbed. On the other hand, the dry and level
pampas gave easy access to the thriving towns of
the province of Tucuman. The Cordoba range, the
greatest of the outworks of the Andes, rises from
the plain less than two hundred miles from the Paran&aacute;
at Santa F&eacute;, and only four hundred miles from
Buenos Aires itself. The city of Cordoba, in the
fertile and well-watered slope at the foot of the
sierra, was the capital of the province, the seat of a
university from 1613, and the centre of Creole culture.
The intercourse of the Buenos Aireans with
their neighbours of the interior constantly increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in spite of the prohibitions of the Spanish government,
while Cordoba and the other towns of Tucuman
prospered with the sale of pack-mules to the
mines of Bolivia.</p>

<p>In the fertile Andean valleys of Rioja and Catamarca
had lived since Inca times the powerful nation
of the Calchaquies. Though they had acknowledged
the suzerainty of the Cuzco emperors, they were
ruled by their own chiefs. The first Spaniards that
penetrated south from the Bolivian plateau failed to
reduce them to submission. After a bitter experience
the invaders passed to the west. For fifty
years this gallant people were left undisturbed in
their Andean fastnesses. Late in the sixteenth
century aggressions again began. The Indians
fought desperately, but were overcome. Forty
thousand were sold into slavery; eleven thousand
were exiled to Santiago del Estero, to Santa F&eacute;,
and Buenos Aires. The town of Quilmes, now one
of the suburbs of Buenos Aires, was named from the
mountain fastness where the Calchaquies made their
last stand. Rosario was also settled by families of
these brave Indians who were dragged across the
pampas by the victorious Spaniards.</p>

<p>About 1655 a leader presented himself to the remnants
of this warlike people, claiming to be the
descendant and heir of the ancient Inca princes.
He was known to the Indians as Huallpa-Inca, while
the Spaniards called him Bohorquez. A woman of
his own race, by the name of Colla, accompanied
him, and she was greeted with all the ceremonious
honours that belonged to the Inca Queen according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to ancient customs. Even the Jesuit missionaries
recognised the validity of the claims of Bohorquez,
but the governor regarded him only as a menace to
Spanish rule. He was pursued relentlessly; his followers
rose in revolt; the rebellion spread northwards,
but with the capture of the Inca it collapsed.
He was sent to Lima, tried for treason, and executed,
while the Calchaquies were placed under a
military deputy-governor, subordinate to the governor
of Tucuman. Their descendants have repeatedly
proved that they came of fighting stock. They were
among the best soldiers on the patriot side in the
war of independence; the province of Rioja never
submitted to Rosas, it resisted Mitre even after
Pavon, the last and decisive battle of the civil wars,
and it was the last province to give its allegiance to
the confederation.</p>

<p>The third province into which the whole territory
which is now Argentina was then divided, was Cuyo,&mdash;including
the three modern provinces of Mendoza,
San Juan, and San Luiz. In its early years, these
settlements did not extend far from the Andes.
Late in the sixteenth century San Luiz was added,
thus connecting the Spanish dominions from Chile
across to the borders of Cordoba.</p>

<p>The complicity of the Spanish governors with the
contraband commerce which they were especially
charged to suppress is abundantly shown by contemporary
documents. The very first governor sent to
Buenos Aires after its erection into a separate province
was accused of agreeing to allow a Lisbon merchant
to land a shipload of goods. He fled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
sanctuary among the Jesuits and there perished of
grief and shame. But others were more impudent
and successful. Mercado Villacorta came to his post
announcing that he would so effectively enforce the
prohibition that "not a bird could pass with food in
its beak from Buenos Aires to the interior." However,
not many months passed before a Dutch ship
applied for permission to disembark its cargo, presenting
papers signed by a natural son of King Philip
himself. The captain offered to turn over his cargo
in return for a certain amount of hides, wool, silver,
and enough food to take him back to Flanders. The
proposition, on its face, was very advantageous, and
Villacorta accepted it on account of the royal treasury.
He made a faithful return of the enormous
profits accruing from the cargo of the ship in question,
but neglected to report that three other Dutch
ships were anchored just out of sight and that she
passed over to them in the night what had been
laden on her the day before. By chance, a royal
commissioner was in Flanders and watched the unlading
of all four ships. He certified that three
million dollars worth of hides, wool, woods, and
silver were taken out of their holds. Villacorta was
cashiered for the moment, but a few years later we
find him installed as governor of Tucuman. Another
governor, Andres de Robles, engaged so publicly
and impudently in fraudulent transactions and corrupt
contracts that his conduct was the text of sermons
in all the churches, but he calmly went his
way and paid no attention to the clerical boycott
and priestly denunciations.  Imports by way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Buenos Aires increased so rapidly that soon the
Cadiz monopolists were complaining to the Council
of the Indies that the Potos&iacute; shops were filled with
goods which had come by way of the Plate. Absolute
prohibition had manifestly failed, and so palliative
measures were tried. Permission was given to
special ships to sail from Cadiz for Buenos Aires,
carrying only enough merchandise to supply the
demand of Buenos Aires itself, and giving bonds to
return to Cadiz, so that the return cargo could be
checked over to see that no silver was included.
Naturally, this system proved impracticable and
only opened another road to evasion.</p>

<p>The first severe blow to the extension of the
Spanish dominions over the valley of the Paran&aacute;
was struck by the Portuguese Creoles of S&atilde;o Paulo
in 1632. Though King Philip of Spain was at that
time also monarch of Portugal and Brazil, the Paulistas
viewed with alarm and jealousy the encroachments
of the Jesuits into the regions lying to the
south-east of the homes they had occupied for a
century. They had had a hard fight to keep the
Jesuits from establishing villages in their own neighbourhood,
and now they saw these old enemies
creeping up the slope of the tributaries of the Upper
Paran&aacute;, shutting them off from expansion over the
remoter interior. The Paulistas hated Spaniards
and Jesuits; they wanted Indian slaves; they recked
little of the fine-spun discussions as to the whereabouts
of the dividing line between the Castilian
and Portuguese possessions; their allegiance to the
Spanish monarch sat lightly upon them. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
homes were on the headwaters of tributaries of the
Paran&aacute;, and their expeditions followed fearlessly
down the streams and across the plateau and burst
unheralded on the northern villages of the Jesuits.
The poor Indians were defenceless and totally unprepared.
The Jesuits had taught them the arts of
peace but not of war; they had no arms; their
spiritual rulers had bethought themselves safe in
these remote plateaux in the middle of the continent;
the few thousands of Paulistas, away over on
the Atlantic border, had not been considered worth
taking into consideration. Though few in number,
the band of Portuguese Creoles created immense
havoc. The Jesuit chroniclers say that three thousand
Paulistas killed and carried away into captivity
four hundred thousand Indians in a few years. This
is certainly an exaggeration, but we know that all
the Jesuit villages were wiped out as far south as
the Iguassu, and that north of that tributary the
Spanish line was pushed back to the Paran&aacute;. The
Jesuits protested, but their complaints availed nothing.
A few years later Portugal regained its independence
of Spain and the work of the Paulistas
stood. Spain lost her opportunity of securing the
whole Plate valley, and the way was opened to the
Brazilians to make the interior of the continent
Portuguese.</p>

<p>The Paulistas' raids extended as far as the Jesuit
villages in Paraguay and those on the Upper Uruguay,
but here the priests managed to hold their
own. Portugal's next move toward getting possession
of all the territory east of the Paran&aacute; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Uruguay was made from the coast. In 1680, an
expedition sent by the governor of Rio landed
directly opposite the city of Buenos Aires and built
a fort&mdash;calling it Colonia. This was the first permanent
occupation of Uruguayan soil, either by
Portugal or Spain. Both nations claimed it under
differing interpretations of the Treaty of Tordesillas.
Portuguese historians claim that the Paulistas
had explored and asserted a right to the region in
the early years of the seventeenth century; and
Spanish authorities state that Jesuits had established
a mission on the Lower Uruguay about the
same time. As a matter of fact, Colonia was the
first permanent European settlement south of Santa
Catharina and north of the Plate, on or near the
Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>The governor of Buenos Aires promptly raised a
force, sailed across the estuary, and captured the
new fort. However, Spain's diplomatic position in
Europe at the time did not justify risking serious
trouble over a matter that seemed so trifling as the
possession of a piece of desert in South America.
The governor was ordered to restore Colonia to the
Portuguese authorities, leaving open for subsequent
discussion and determination the question as to
which nation was entitled to the territory on the
north bank. With some interruptions, Portugal
remained in possession of the port of Colonia for a
century, and its existence was a constant source of
annoyance to the Buenos Aireans. It immediately
became a rival for the trade with the interior, and
its merchants had the advantage of the open aid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
their own government. Their competitors at Buenos
Aires across the river were confessedly engaged in
breaking the law of their country. Exportable
goods were never safe from seizure until they had
left Argentine soil. Colonia was a convenient storing-place,
and the river crafts, once within its port,
could discharge at their leisure, free from anxiety
that active officials might threaten to enforce inconvenient
laws. Every time a war broke out between
the two countries in Europe, the exasperated governor
of Buenos Aires would send over an expedition
and capture the Portuguese town. Three times was
it taken and as often restored on the conclusion of
peace. Colonia in Portuguese hands interfered with
the trade of Buenos Aires merchants, and the illicit
gains of Spanish officials, and also destroyed any
remnant of efficiency remaining to the prohibition
of commerce across the Atlantic. Back of these
commercial and temporary considerations was the
menace to the future occupancy by Spaniards of the
vast and fertile region extending from the boundaries
of S&atilde;o Paulo to the mouth of the Uruguay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>


<p>The rapid decadence of Spain itself during the
reigns of the last kings of the House of Austria
was reflected in the colonies. With the accession
of the Bourbons a forward movement began, and
the colonial administration was roused into an appearance
of activity. Something was done in the
direction of adopting a more rational commercial
policy, but it was already too late. The control of
trade had irrevocably passed to Holland and England,
and Spain could not recover the business of
her own colonies. The efforts to improve administration
were largely nullified by the conservatism of
her aristocracy. It seemed that her medi&aelig;val governmental
machinery could not be adapted to the
conditions created by her active rivals.</p>

<p>In 1726, Montevideo, the strategic key to Uruguay
and the north bank of the Plate, was occupied and
fortified. Thereafter, though Colonia still remained
in Portuguese hands, it was isolated and scarcely tenable.
Immediately the north shore of the Uruguay
began to be settled by Spaniards. Simultaneously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the ranchers of the right bank of the Paran&aacute;, who
had long been tempted by the fine pastures on
the opposite shore, finally ventured to secure a foothold
in Entre Rios. The warlike Charruas had kept
the white man out of this favoured region for two
centuries, although it was so near to Buenos Aires.
They did not yield without a struggle, but they
were overcome, and those who refused to submit
fled to the east bank of the Uruguay River&mdash;the present
country of that name. There they were followed
by the proselyting Jesuits, and it was only a
question of a few years before the Argentines proper
had crossed the Uruguay and were pasturing their
herds in the rolling champaign country that extends
from that river to the sea. The Spanish advance
would have continued up the coast, probably as far
as the northern boundary of the Rio Grande do Sul,
if the Portuguese had not in the meantime established
a town and fort at the mouth of the Duck
Lagoon, which is the only port that gives access to
the interior of that most valuable region.</p>

<p>The increase of population, the extension of the
occupied pasture-ground, and the greater demand
from Europe for hides and wool, tended to multiply
the volume and value of Argentine exportable commodities.
Northern Europe made marvellous strides
in purchasing power during the eighteenth century,
and prices all over the world felt the impetus. The
commercial policy of the Spanish government became
more lax and the trade prohibition fell into
contempt and disuse. The system of fleets of Spanish
ships under convoy was abandoned, and single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
ships, mostly foreign owned, and trusting to their
sailing qualities and equipment to escape capture,
carried all the trade. The trade of Buenos Aires
grew and the population of the city increased in proportion.
The exhaustion of the surface deposits
and richer lodes of precious metals in the mining
provinces during the eighteenth century tended to
increase the relative importance of Buenos Aires and
her territory, even in the mind of the Spanish government,
and to turn a current of immigration toward
the pastoral and agricultural provinces.</p>

<p>In 1750 the Spanish government made an effort to
get rid of the Portuguese in Colonia by negotiation.
Portugal agreed to exchange that port for the Jesuit
Missions which covered the fine pastures in the western
half of the present Brazilian state of Rio Grande.
The helpless Indians were driven off or massacred in
spite of their feeble resistance, but as soon as the
treaty was made public, Spanish and Jesuit protests
against the abandonment of the territory were so
violent that the agreement was formally annulled by
mutual consent. The Portuguese retained Colonia,
and though they gave up their formal claims to
the Missions the military operations they had so
promptly undertaken against that region had pretty
well rooted out Spanish influence on the east bank
of the Upper Uruguay. It was never re-established,
and the dividing line of 1750 is still substantially the
boundary between Spanish and Portuguese South
America.</p>

<p>In 1767 Spain followed the example of Portugal
and France and expelled the Jesuits from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
dominions. For generations they had been the largest
property holders in the Plate provinces. In the
larger towns popular education was in their hands.
Their great schools, convents, and churches were
the finest edifices in the country. To endow their
educational and religious work they had accumulated
town houses, ranches, plantations, mills, cattle,
ships, and even slaves. Along the banks of
the Upper Paran&aacute; and Uruguay they had succeeded
in dominating and absorbing the whole productive
life of the community. Their system in the Indian
regions smothered everything else; no white man
was allowed to visit their settlements; the Indians
were kept in absolute ignorance of the existence of
an external world; the Jesuits required their subjects
to work, gathering matte tea, cutting wood,
cultivating the soil, and tending cattle. However,
the Indians were kindly treated and were content
with the easy life they enjoyed under the mild Jesuit
rule. The Fathers exported immense quantities of
hides and controlled the production of matte, then,
as now, the favourite drink of Creoles and Indians
in the southern half of the continent. The Indians
received their living and the Jesuits absorbed the
surplus. Their misfortunes in Brazil had taught
them a lesson, and they had tried to erect their theocracy
in regions where they need not come into close
contact and constant conflict with the lay settlers.
For a century, they had been left undisturbed in
South-eastern Paraguay and the region between the
Upper Paran&aacute; and Paraguay.</p>

<p>Neither their services to civilisation nor regard for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the interests of the Indians, nor their wealth and influence,
could avail anything against the mandate of
the Spanish monarch, backed by the Vatican and
joyfully enforced by the colonial authorities. The
Jesuits who had been employed in teaching in the
towns were incontinently imprisoned and summarily
shipped off across the seas, while their schools were
placed under the charge of other ecclesiastics, and
their estates sold at auction. In the missions resistance
was anticipated, but none was made. The
Indians, accustomed to look to the Fathers for
guidance in everything, were aghast when they saw
the Jesuits leaving, and Spanish officials taking their
places. The new shepherds had not the skill to
drive the flocks to the shearing, and could not keep
the Indians together so as to exploit them for the
benefit of the royal treasury. From their cruelties
and exactions the Indians fled and sought refuge
among the Creole settlements of Entre Rios and
Uruguay, where they constituted a valuable addition
to the population.</p>

<p>This transplantation had hardly been accomplished
when the Spanish government took a step
which revolutionised the administration of the
southern half of the continent during the remainder
of colonial times, and determined the future boundaries
of the nations of South America. On the
1st of August, 1776, the Viceroyalty of Buenos
Aires was created. All the territory south of Lake
Titicaca was separated from the Viceroyalty of Peru,
and the province of Cuyo was detached from the
Captaincy-General of Chile. The new Viceroyalty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
covered the territory that has since become the four
countries&mdash;Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.
In colonial times it was divided into eight
"intendencias," of which the northern four covered
the region that is now Bolivia and was then known
as Upper Peru. The four southern intendencias
were: Paraguay; Salta, covering the northwestern
provinces; Cordoba, covering the central and western
provinces; and, finally, Buenos Aires, which,
besides the present province, included Santa F&eacute;, the
whole mesopotamian region, Uruguay, and the
Jesuit country of the Upper Paran&aacute;.</p>

<p>The creation of the Viceroyalty was a reluctant
and tardy reversal of the colonial policy which had
steadfastly refused to recognise in Buenos Aires the
inevitable outlet of the region. Although the four
northern intendencias contained more than half the
population, and Paraguay probably half the remainder,
Buenos Aires was made the capital. Situated
at the mouth of the great system of waterways, it
was the natural commercial centre of the whole
Viceroyalty. In fifty years it had doubled in population,
while the old cities on the Bolivian plateau
had remained stationary. In 1776 its population
did not much exceed twenty thousand souls, but
was rapidly increasing. Heretofore, it had been
rather a resort of smuggling merchants than a centre
of political and social influence. Nevertheless, from
this unpromising root was to spring the spreading
tree of South American independence. Buenos
Aires is the only capital that never readmitted the
Spanish authorities, once they had been expelled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and within her walls San Martin drilled the nucleus
of the armies that drove the Spaniards out of Chile
and Peru.</p>

<span class="caption">AN OLD SPANISH CORNER IN BUENOS AIRES.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>The alarming growth of the Portuguese power
southward was another potent reason for the establishment
of a strong and independent military jurisdiction
at the mouth of the Plate. The Spanish
government had at last determined on vigorous
measures to take Colonia, drive the Portuguese from
Rio Grande, and push the Spanish boundaries east
to the original Tordesillas line. Pedro de Zeballos,
the first Viceroy, sailed in November, 1776, in
command of the largest force which up to that time
had been sent to the Western Continent. Against
his twenty-one thousand men and great fleet the
Portuguese had no force, military or naval, strong
enough to make a serious resistance.</p>

<p>The flourishing Brazilian settlement of Santa
Catharina was easily reduced, and, leaving it garrisoned,
the fleet and army went on to the Plate.
Colonia surrendered without resistance, and the
army prepared to march northward and drive the
Portuguese from all the coast as far north as Santa
Catharina. Hardly was the advance begun, when
news was received that peace between Spain and
Portugal had been signed. The latter retained
eastern Rio Grande, and Santa Catharina was restored,
while Spain's title to Uruguay and the Missions
was recognised.</p>

<p>Zeballos returned to Buenos Aires and actively
engaged in the military and civil organisation of the
new Viceroyalty. A fresh set of special regulations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had been prepared in Spain, creating an elaborate
hierarchy of executives. The chief provincial governors,
now called "intendentes," were subject to
the orders of the Viceroy in military matters, but as
to taxation they were directly responsible to the
Crown. They were entrusted with the paying of
governmental employees, which gave them great
influence with the Cabildos and functionaries.</p>

<p>The intention of the Spanish government was
manifestly to enforce close relationship and greater
subjection to the central authority at Madrid. In
practice, however, the financial independence of the
provincial governors stimulated the feeling of local
independence, increased the influence of the Cabildos,
and paved the way for the revolution.</p>

<p>Since 1765 the rest of South America had enjoyed
the privilege of free commerce from the mother
country. Now, the same rule was applied to Buenos
Aires, and trade with Spain quickly attained respectable
dimensions. In the five years from 1792 to
1796 more than one hundred ships made the voyage
to Spain, and exports ran up to five million dollars
annually. Buenos Aires became the <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> of the
wine and brandy of Cuyo; the poncho and hides of
Tucuman; the tobacco, woods, and matte tea of
Paraguay; the gold and silver of Upper Peru; the
copper of Chile; and even the sugar, cacao, and rice
of Lower Peru. By the end of the century the
population of the city was forty thousand. Thirty
thousand more lived in the immediate vicinity;
Montevideo had seven thousand, and the outlying
settlements of Uruguay twenty-five thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
inhabitants. The civilised population of the Buenos
Aires intendencia was about one hundred and seventy
thousand, and in population and in wealth it
had become easily the first among the eight great
districts of the Viceroyalty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>The Viceroyalty was a heterogeneous mass. The
common subjection of its component parts to
the Viceroy gave it a mere appearance of cohesion.
The centring of the commercial currents in Buenos
Aires did not furnish an organic connection sufficiently
strong to unite provinces and cities so widely
separated and so different in social and industrial
constitution. Upper Peru had been a mining region,
and its white population was largely of a shifting
character. The bulk of the population were Indians,
and the inhabitants of Spanish blood were
still taskmasters. Society was as yet in unstable
equilibrium, and the different elements had not
thoroughly coalesced. Paraguay was an isolated
and almost self-sufficing commonwealth. It was essentially
theocratic, and averse to receiving external
impressions. In Salta and Cordoba the proportion
of Indian blood was not so preponderant as in Bolivia
and Paraguay; agriculture was the economic basis;
the Creoles and Indians had largely amalgamated
politically and socially; and, though the people of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Spanish descent lived mostly in the towns, they
were in close and friendly contact with the civilised
Indians who laboured in the irrigated valleys. On
the wide pampas a new race of men had sprung into
existence&mdash;the gauchos, whose business was the
herding of cattle, whose homes were their saddles,
and who were as impatient of control and as hard to
deprive of personal liberty as Arabs or Parthians.
The proportion of white blood increased toward the
coast. Buenos Aires was the boom town of the
region and the time. Its population was recruited
from among the most adventurous and enterprising
Spaniards and Creoles. Lima and Mexico were
centres of aristocracy and bureaucracy, while the
social organisation of Buenos Aires and its surrounding
territory was completely democratic. All were
equal in fact; neither nobles nor serfs existed; the
Viceroy was little more than a new official imposed
by external authority, and having no real support in
the country itself. It is not a mere coincidence that
the three centres&mdash;Caracas, Buenos Aires, and Pernambuco&mdash;whence
the revolutionary spirit spread
over South America should all have been democratic
in social organisation and far distant from the
old colonial capitals. In Buenos Aires, the Viceroy
himself could not find a white coachman. An
Argentine Creole would no more serve in a menial
capacity than a North American pioneer; and a
Creole hated a Spaniard very much as his contemporary,
the Scotch-Irish settler of the Appalachians,
hated an Englishman.</p>

<p>Not even religion furnished a strong bond of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
union between the widely dispersed cities and provinces
of the Viceroyalty. The priests had not been
organised into a compact hierarchy. They had little
class feeling; they lived the life of the Creoles and
shared the same prejudices. Half the members of
the first Congress after the revolution were priests,
but they pursued no distinctive policy of their own
and offered no effective resistance to the growth of
the power of the military chiefs.</p>

<p>Commerce with Spain had been authorised, but
with other nations it was still unlawful. The Cadiz
monopolists still fought hard to preserve their privileges
and to control the Atlantic trade as they had
controlled the route by the Isthmus. Great Britain
had enjoyed a monopoly of the traffic in negroes during
most of the colonial period, but in 1784 all foreign
ships carrying slaves were allowed to enter, unload,
and take a return cargo of the "products of the
country." The Cadiz merchants contended that
hides&mdash;then the principal article of export&mdash;were
not "products" within the meaning of this law, and
the Spanish courts decided in their favour. This
absurd decision created a storm of opposition in
Buenos Aires, but even more unreasonable restrictions
continued to be insisted upon. The proposition
to allow the colonies to trade with one another
was vehemently opposed by the people of Cadiz and
their agents in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, England's maritime victories in the
wars of the French Revolution were sweeping Spanish
commerce from the sea, and the people of the
Plate saw themselves again about to be shut off from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the sea unless permission were granted to ship in
foreign vessels. Dissatisfaction grew apace, and
the prestige of the Viceregal government and the
influence of resident Spaniards were seriously compromised.
At the same time there were fermenting
among the intelligent and educated youth of the
city the new ideas of the North American and
French revolutions&mdash;liberty, the rights of man, representative
government, and popular sovereignty.</p>

<p>For generations England had cast covetous eyes
at South Africa and South America. Menaced with
exclusion from Europe in her giant conflict with
Napoleon, her statesmen determined to seize outside
markets and possessions. The Cape was captured
in 1805, and the next year came the turn of
Argentina. June 25, 1806, Admiral Popham appeared
in the estuary, and fifteen hundred troops,
under the command of General Beresford, were disembarked
a few miles below Buenos Aires. The
Viceroy fled without making resistance, and on the
27th the British flag was run up on his official residence.
At first the population appeared to acquiesce,
but finally Liniers, a French officer in the Spanish
employ, gathered together at Montevideo a thousand
regulars and a small amount of artillery. The
militia of Buenos Aires soon proved themselves anxious
to rise against the heretic strangers. Liniers
crossed the estuary and, advancing without opposition
to the neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, established
a camp to which the patriotic inhabitants
flocked. Within a short time he had armed an
overwhelming number of the citizens, the scanty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
British garrison was shut up in the fort, and on the
12th of August the Argentines advanced. After
some hard street fighting, the English were forced
to surrender, and the flags which were captured that
day are still exhibited in the city of Buenos Aires
with just pride as trophies of Argentine valour.
The British expedition might have been successful
had it been more numerous, or had it been promptly
re-enforced. If the capture of Montevideo had followed
that of Buenos Aires, the Argentines would
have had no base of operations, and their militia
would have remained without ammunition and artillery
stores. It is interesting to speculate what
would have been the subsequent history of the temperate
part of South America in such a case. It is
possible that the Plate would have become part of
the British Dominion; British immigration would
have followed, and the Plate might have become the
greatest of British colonies.</p>

<p>But the opportunity was quickly gone. The successes
of 1806 so strongly aroused the spirit of national
and race pride that thereafter the conquest
of Argentina was a task too great for the small
armies which in those days could be transported
overseas. No sooner was Beresford expelled than
the victors met in open Cabildo, declared the cowardly
Viceroy suspended from office, and installed
the royal Audiencia in his place. A few months
later the dreaded British re-enforcement came.
Four thousand men disembarked in eastern Uruguay,
and Montevideo was taken by assault. In Buenos
Aires all was confusion, but the people were resol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ute
to resist. Again an open Cabildo assembled,
and Liniers, the French officer under whose leadership
the victory of last year had been won, was given
supreme authority. Military enthusiasm spread
among all classes and the people were rapidly enrolled
in volunteer regiments. When General
Whitelocke approached the city with several thousand
regulars the Argentines confidently marched
out to meet him. In the open they stood no chance,
and they were compelled to fly back to the shelter
of their narrow streets and stone houses. On the
5th of July, 1807, the British troops, disdaining all
precautions, marched into the city. Both sides of
the narrow streets were lined with low, fireproof
houses, whose flat roofs afforded admirable vantage-ground.
The Buenos Aires men were well supplied
with muskets, and the women and boys rained
down stones, bricks, and firebrands on the masses
crowding the pavements below. The British could
not retaliate on their enemies, but pushed stubbornly
on toward the centre of the city, dropping by
hundreds on the way. At the main square, in front
of the fort, barricades had been thrown up, and
there the English met a reception which flesh and
blood could not endure. For two days the conflict
raged, but finally the English general was obliged
to give up and ask for terms. He had lost a fourth
of his force and was allowed to withdraw the remainder
only on agreeing to evacuate Montevideo
within two months.</p>

<p>The political and commercial consequences of the
English invasions were vastly important.  The mili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>tary
power of the Argentine Creoles, hitherto unsuspected,
stood revealed; local pride had been
stimulated; and, at the same time, the invasions
gave a tremendous impulse to foreign commerce.
A fleet of English merchantmen had followed the
warships. Untrammelled commerce with the world
at last became a fact. English manufactured goods
flooded the market. Articles until then beyond
the reach of all but the wealthiest now became
cheap enough for the purses of the gauchos. Buenos
Aires's trade was boomed by the sales of imported
goods to the interior provinces. Creole
jealousy of Spaniards rapidly became accentuated.
From this time dates the general use of "Goths,"
applied to Spaniards as a term of opprobrium, and
of "Argentines," as a designation for the natives
of the Plate. Recognition could no longer be withheld
from the men who had organised and commanded
victorious troops, and henceforth the Creoles
were in fact, as well as in law, eligible to offices of
trust and profit. Even in the Buenos Aires Cabildo,
though all the members were native Spaniards,
Creole ideas predominated.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the English retired from Montevideo
when the course of events in Europe precipitated
Spanish South America into confusion. Charles
IV., the pusillanimous King of Spain, allied himself
with Napoleon and aided the latter's aggressions
against Portugal. The Portuguese monarch
was driven to Brazil, the latter country thereby
gaining complete commercial freedom and virtual
political independence.  This naturally suggested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
to the Argentines that they were entitled to the
same privileges from Spain. Charles IV. and
Godoy, the accomplice of his wicked wife, who
really governed in his name, were bitterly hated at
home. Napoleon's troops swarmed over the country
and the monarchy itself was clearly tottering to
its fall. Ferdinand, heir of Charles IV., conspired
against his father and forced the latter to resign in
his favour. The Spanish governor of Montevideo
at once took the oath of allegiance to the new monarch,
an act of insubordination to his titular superior,
the Viceroy. The latter was the Frenchman,
Liniers, who sympathised with the Creole party in
desiring to wait and obtain concessions for the colony
before recognising any of the various claimants.
A dispute over the oath of allegiance to Ferdinand
arose which marked a definite rupture between the
Creoles and the old-line Spaniards&mdash;between those
who regarded the special interests of the colony as
paramount and those who wished at all hazards to
maintain connection with the mother country.</p>

<p>Charles's abdication was only the beginning of
complications. He protested that it had been obtained
from him by duress, and with Ferdinand he
appealed to Napoleon as arbiter. The latter forced
them both to renounce their claims in favour of his
brother Joseph. Everyone in South America was
agreed not to recognise Joseph Bonaparte as King
of Spain, but there was wide diversity of opinion as
to what affirmative action ought to be taken. Most
regarded Ferdinand as the legitimate king, but he
was in a French prison. Charles still claimed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
throne, while provisional governments were formed
in many cities of Spain to resist the enthroning of
Joseph. A central junta at Seville claimed to be
the depositary of supreme executive power pending
Ferdinand's return, and to this junta the Spaniards
of the Plate gave their earnest and unhesitating
allegiance. But the Creoles could not see their way
clear to an unconditional recognition of such a self-constituted
revolutionary body. Few believed that
the Spanish patriots could withstand Napoleon's armies.
If Spain had submitted to Joseph the various
parts of South America would have become
independent without any serious struggle. The
"Goths" in the Plate were united in a definite policy&mdash;loyalty
to the only Spanish government that
was vindicating the nationality. The Creoles could
agree on no affirmative programme, but all of them
were determined that the "Goths" should not get
the upper hand. The latter rose against Liniers and
tried to install a junta on the model of that at Seville.
In view of the menacing attitude of the
Creole militia, the attempt was a failure, but the
Frenchman did not have the resolution to maintain
his advantage. The Seville junta finally named a
Viceroy, and, though some of the resolute spirits
among the militia leaders wished to resist, the majority
shrank from open defiance of the highest
existing Spanish authority. On the 30th of July,
1809, the new Viceroy took possession. He gained
popularity by his decree declaring free commerce
with all the world, but his next act opened the eyes
of the Creoles to the real effect of the re-establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ment
of the Spanish system. He sent a thousand
men to Charcas, in the northern part of the Viceroyalty,
to aid in the bloody suppression of a
revolutionary movement undertaken by the Creole
inhabitants of that city. The story that shortly
came back of wholesale confiscations and executions
widened the breach between Spaniards and Creoles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another crisis in Spanish home affairs
was approaching. Napoleon's armies were sweeping
the Peninsula from end to end. In the early months
of 1810 they overran Andalusia, the centre of resistance.
It seemed as if the subjection of Spain was
about to be completed. On the 18th of May, Viceroy
Cisneros issued a proclamation frankly revealing
the critical situation of the Spanish patriot, and of
the junta under whose commission he was acting.
All classes of Buenos Aires immediately engaged in
feverish discussions as to what should be done. The
Spaniards wished to retain their privileged position;
the Creoles were determined to put an end to
discrimination against themselves. These were the
real purposes of the two parties. The Spaniards
did not especially favour absolutism, nor did the
Creoles in general intend to renounce the sovereignty
of Ferdinand, should he ever escape from
captivity. Among the Creoles were many liberals,
mostly young and ardent men, whom study and
travel had convinced of the necessity for racial reform
and colonial autonomy. Among their leaders
were Saavedra, commander of the most efficient
militia regiment; Vieytes, at whose house the meetings
of the conspirators were held; Manuel Belgrano,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
afterwards the brains and right arm of the movement;
and two eloquent young lawyers, Castelli
and Paso. The active spirits conspired to depose
the Viceroy, confident that this measure would be
popular among all classes of Creoles. On the 22nd
of May a committee of popular chiefs waited on him
to demand his resignation. Resistance was futile,
for he could not rely on the troops. They were
Creoles and proud of the fact that Argentines had
expelled the British. The office-holders tried to
arrange a compromise by which an open Cabildo
should elect the ex-Viceroy president of a new
governing junta. The populace and the militia
would not submit, and on the 25th of May&mdash;now
celebrated as the anniversary of the establishment
of Argentine liberty&mdash;a great armed assembly met
in the Plaza. The Creole badge was blue and white&mdash;then
adopted as the Argentine colours. The proceedings
were frankly revolutionary. A junta was
named from among the Creole leaders, and the
Buenos Aires Cabildo obediently proclaimed this
body the supreme authority of the Viceroyalty.
There was no pretence of consulting the other provinces.
Spanish constitutional law provided no
machinery through which they could be heard, and
the capital assumed, as a matter of course, the right
of governing the dependencies.</p>

<p>The events of the 25th of May were not intended
to sever relations between Spain and Buenos Aires.
The acts of the new government ran in the name of
Ferdinand VII., King of Castile and Leon. An able
and ambitious coterie of young men came to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
front, whose achievements in war, administration,
and diplomacy were to change the face of South America.
In the neighbouring cities there were no spontaneous
uprisings against the Spanish governors, but
the Buenos Aires patriots lost no time in sending
out armies to spread their liberal and anti-Spanish
doctrines. The first movement was towards the old
university town of Cordoba. Here ex-Viceroy
Liniers had managed to get a few troops together,
but not enough to make effective resistance. At
the first encounter they were all captured, and the
Buenos Aires junta immediately ordered the execution
of the captured officers and of the anti-Creole
chiefs. This barbarous act is a fair sample of the
horrible bloodthirstiness of the war between Creoles
and Spanish sympathisers. As a rule, both sides
slew their prisoners, and the combats were, therefore,
incredibly bloody for the numbers engaged.</p>

<p>The Buenos Airean army continued its triumphal
march through the provinces of Cordoba and
Salta up to the Bolivian mountains. The Creole
townspeople reorganised the municipal governments
on an anti-Spanish basis, and the army increased
like a rolling snowball. Not until it had reached the
high lands of Bolivia was serious resistance encountered.
On the 7th of November the patriots
gained the battle of Suipacha. The Creoles of
Bolivia rose, and the Buenos Aireans penetrated
rapidly as far as the boundaries of the Viceroyalty.
Meanwhile, Manuel Belgrano had led a small expedition
to Paraguay. However, the inhabitants of
that isolated region showed no disposition to join<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the Buenos Aireans in their revolutionary movement.
The Spanish governor allowed Belgrano to
advance nearly to Asuncion, but there his little
army was overpowered and forced to surrender on
honourable terms. Montevideo's capture seemed
essential to the safety of Buenos Aires itself. Spanish
ships under the orders of its governor blockaded
the river and constantly menaced an attack on the
patriot capital. Early in 1811, Artigas with a band
of gauchos from Entre Rios crossed the Uruguay
and overran the country up to the walls of the fortress,
defeating the Spaniards in the battle of Piedras.
Re-enforcements came from Buenos Aires, and a
siege of Montevideo was begun.</p>

<p>At this juncture news came of a great disaster in
the north. The Argentines had at first been joined
by Bolivian patriots, but the latter were jealous;
and the former, bred on the plains, could not well
endure the high altitude, suffering in health and efficiency.
The Viceroy of Peru rapidly recruited a
considerable army among the sturdy and obedient
Indians of the high Peruvian plateau. On the 20th
of June, 1811, the patriot army was attacked at
Huaqui, near the southern end of Lake Titicaca, and
was virtually annihilated. Bolivia was lost to the
patriots and Spanish authority was re-established as
far down as the Argentine plains.</p>

<p>This great defeat completely changed the attitude
of affairs. The Argentines evacuated Uruguay, and
the Spanish colonial authorities everywhere took the
offensive. The heroic resistance which the Spanish
people were now making to the army of Napoleon's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
marshals encouraged the Viceroy and governor to
believe that Ferdinand would soon again be seated
on the throne of his fathers. Spanish ships dominated
the delta of the Paran&aacute;, and the Spanish troops
from Montevideo descended at pleasure on the banks
of the Plate or its tributaries. The Spanish residents
at Buenos Aires plotted against the junta, but
their conspiracy was betrayed, and in the middle of
1812 their chiefs, to the number of thirty-eight,
mostly wealthy merchants, were arrested and garrotted.
The situation of the revolutionary government
was so desperate that it is not hard to
understand why the junta ruthlessly repressed all
signs of disaffection. Victorious Spanish armies
threatened them from both Bolivia and Montevideo,
and fire in the rear would have been fatal.</p>

<p>In this crisis of their fate, Manuel Belgrano, the
great leader of the Buenos Aires Creoles, came to
the front. A native of the city, he had been educated
in Spain, where he had imbibed liberal principles.
On his return he threw himself with all the
prestige of his learning, talents, and wealth on the
side of the Creoles. His faith in the triumph of
liberal principles was unalterable, and he was a more
radical advocate of independence than most of his
associates. Though without military training, and
though his expeditions in Paraguay and Uruguay
had not been successful, his prestige and his unwavering
confidence in the patriot cause pointed
him out as naturally the fittest leader. Again he
was entrusted with the command, and went north
to Tucuman, where the disheartened fragments of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the patriot army were fearfully waiting for the descent
of the victorious Spaniards. The inhabitants
of Jujuy and Salta had been driven from their homes,
and for the first time gaucho horsemen appeared as
the principal element of an Argentine army. The
junta ordered Belgrano to retire, so as to protect
Buenos Aires, but he disobeyed and stuck to Tucuman
and let the Spaniards get between him and the
capital. With the country up in arms, and the exasperated
gauchos harassing his march, the Spanish
general did not dare leave Belgrano's army behind
him. The Spanish army turned back to Tucuman
to finish with the mass of militia there before resuming
its march on the capital. To the surprise
of South America, the result was a decisive patriot
victory. The gaucho cavalry, armed with knives
and bolos, mounted on fleet little horses, carrying
no baggage, and living on the cattle they killed at
the end of each day's march, followed the fleeing
Spaniards up into the mountains and inflicted enormous
losses. This victory gave the Argentines for
another year assurance against invasion by land, and
Buenos Aires remained a focus whence anti-Spanish
influences could spread over the rest of South America.
The patriots again invaded Uruguay, shut up
the Spaniards within the walls of Montevideo, and
prepared once more to carry the war into Bolivia.</p>

<span class="caption">MANUEL BELGRANO.<br />

</div>

<p>All this while the government at Buenos Aires
was involved in internal quarrels. The first junta
soon expelled its fiercest, strongest, and most active
spirit,&mdash;Moreno,&mdash;who seems to have been the only
man of the period who foresaw the necessity of
establishing a federative form of government. With
the disaster of Huaqui the necessity for a more
compact executive became urgent. A triumvirate
assumed the direction of affairs. Its policy was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
once despotic and feeble and satisfied neither federalists,
advanced liberals, nor the military element.
The latter was becoming daily more predominant.
A radical republican society called the "Lautaro,"
composed largely of young officers, was organised
and became virtually a ruling oligarchy. San Martin
and Alvear arrived from Europe, and the prestige
which they had acquired on European battle-fields
at once secured for them prominent positions.
When the news of the victory of Tucuman reached
the city the military classes revolted, deposed the
old triumvirate, and installed a new one. This
revolution marked the final triumph of the sentiment
of independence. The new government was
active in every sense of the word. Belgrano was re-enforced;
San Martin was encouraged in his chosen
work of forming the nucleus of a disciplined army,
fit for offensive warfare; the worn-out pretence of
employing Ferdinand's name on public documents
was dropped; the inquisition, the use of torture, and
titles of nobility were abolished. The Argentine
revolution had finally assumed a military and republican
character; independence was clearly henceforth
its end and purpose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>COMPLETION OF THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>


<p>Belgrano followed up his victory at Tucuman
by another invasion of the Bolivian plateau.
Even to a trained general and a regular army such a
campaign would have been difficult. The defective
organisation of his hastily gathered militia, his own
unfamiliarity with the art of war, and the fact that
he was opposed by a clever commander whose army
was better drilled and better adapted to operations
in that high altitude, all conspired to leave the result
in no doubt. October 1, 1813, he was badly defeated
at Vilapugio, and six weeks later his army
was nearly destroyed at Ayohuma. With the remnant
he fled south to Argentine territory and was
replaced in his command by San Martin.</p>

<p>The advent of this consummate general and single-minded
patriot revolutionised the character of the
military operations. Unlike his predecessors and
colleagues, he did not concern himself with political
ambitions. He had but one purpose&mdash;to drive the
Spaniards from South America; he knew but one
way of achieving it&mdash;to whip them on the field of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
battle. He had none of the brilliantly attractive
qualities, none of the eloquence or charm of most
South American leaders; he had a horror of display,
and made but one speech in all his life.</p>

<p>By sheer force of will and attention to detail, he
organised an efficient regular army. The victories
that followed were as much due to his painstaking
care and foresight as to his brilliant strategical combinations
and admirable tactical dispositions. Because
he thought another could finish his work better
than himself he voluntarily resigned supreme power
on the very eve of the campaign which expelled the
last Spaniard from South America, and, disdaining
to offer an explanation, went into life-long exile.
So modest was he that his name and services well-nigh
fell into oblivion. That he is now recognised
as the saviour of South American liberty is due as
much to the literary labours of the greatest of
Argentine historians, Bartolom&eacute; Mitre, as to the
spontaneous opinion of his countrymen during the
first decades after his retirement.</p>

<img src="images/illus-119.jpg" width="639" height="600" alt="GENERAL SAN MARTIN." title="" />
<span class="caption">GENERAL SAN MARTIN.<br />
[From a steel engraving.]</span>
</div>

<p>General San Martin was born on the 25th of February,
1778, in a little town which had been one of
the Jesuit missions far up the Uruguay River. His
mother was a Creole and his father a Spanish officer,
who destined his son to his own profession. When
a child of only eight, he was taken to the mother
country and educated in the best military schools of
Spain. At an early age he entered the army and
served in all the many wars in which Spain engaged
after the outbreak of the French Revolution. He
saw much active service and became a thorough
master of his profession. He imbibed liberal ideas
and joined a secret society pledged to the work of
establishing a republic in Spain and independent
governments in her colonies. When the Spanish
people rose against the French conquests, San Martin
threw himself heart and soul into the conflict on
the side of the patriots, and distinguished himself
in the battles that opened the way to the recovery
of Madrid. He was promoted to a lieutenant-colo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>nelcy,
but the next year he resigned his commission
to return to his native land to aid her in her
fight for independence. By a curious coincidence
the ship that bore the South American who achieved
the independence of his country was called the
<i>George Canning</i>, after the European who, thirteen
years later, did most to secure the independence of
South America from external attack. He landed
in Buenos Aires in March, 1812. At that moment
the anti-Spanish revolution seemed everywhere to
be on the point of suffocation. Bolivia and Uruguay
were lost; the reaction was gaining ground in
Venezuela; Chile was menaced by an army from
Lima and shortly fell back into Spanish hands;
Peru was steady for the old system. Only in
Argentina and New Granada were the fires of insurrection
still burning, and between them intervened
Peru, the stronghold of Spanish power in South
America&mdash;a citadel impregnable behind mountains,
deserts, and the ocean. The War of Independence
could only succeed by aggressive campaigns which
must be conducted through difficult country and
over the whole continent, and against forces superior
in both numbers and equipment.</p>

<p>San Martin's first step was to organise and drill
some good regiments in Buenos Aires. He selected
the finest physical and moral specimens of youth
that the province afforded and subjected them to a
rigid discipline. After his ruthless pruning only the
born soldiers remained, and this select corps furnished
generals and officers for the wars that followed.
On succeeding Belgrano in command of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
army of the north, San Martin saw at once that
all attempts to conquer Peru by an advance through
Bolivia were foredoomed to failure. A campaign
over a mountainous plateau, with the Spaniards in
possession of the strategic points, and the inhabitants
divided in their sympathies, would be suicidal.
On the other hand, to attack and defeat the Spanish
forces in Peru itself was absolutely necessary.
The three hundred thousand inhabitants of Argentina,
distracted by intestine warfare, could not hope
indefinitely to resist the Spanish power, backed by
secure possession of the rest of the continent. Decisive
victories were necessary to encourage the
partisans of independence in Chile, Peru, Bolivia,
and Ecuador.</p>

<p>San Martin's solution of the problem was to organise
an army on the eastern slope of the Andes;
to invade Chile; to drive the Spaniards thence, and
make that country the base of further operations; to
improvise a fleet and with it gain command of the
Pacific; and, finally, to attack Peru from the coast.
The scheme seemed complicated, but San Martin
was one of those rare geniuses born with a capacity
for taking infinite pains, and his pertinacity was indefatigable.
He foresaw and provided against every
contingency and carried his plan to a triumphant
conclusion. The story of the liberation of South
America within the succeeding eight years might be
completely told in the form of two biographies&mdash;San
Martin's and Bolivar's.</p>

<p>Trusting the defence of the Bolivian frontier to
a few line soldiers and the gauchos of Salta, San<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Martin solicited and obtained an appointment as
Governor of Cuyo. This province was directly east
of the populous central part of Chile, and was the
refuge of the patriot Chileans who had been compelled
to flee into exile after quarrels among themselves
had delivered their country to the Spaniards.
His authority was purely military and derived only
from the dictum of the revolutionary government at
Buenos Aires, but San Martin was not a man
to hesitate on account of scruples over constitutional
questions. He laid the province under contribution
and started to create an army capable of
crossing the Andes and coping with the Spanish
regulars in Chile. The inhabitants of Cuyo were
determinedly anti-Spanish, brave, enduring, and
enthusiastic. It was a good recruiting ground in
itself; the Chilean exiles were numerous and all
anxious to join in an effort to redeem their country.
The government at Buenos Aires sent him a valuable
addition in a corps of manumitted negro slaves,
but his nucleus was the regiments which he himself
had drilled at Buenos Aires. Though civil wars
went on in the coast provinces, he was not to be
diverted from his purpose. He kept aloof from
them, and for three years laboured steadily, building
his great war machine&mdash;recruiting, drilling, instructing
officers, taxing his province, gathering
provisions, building portable bridges, making powder,
casting guns, organising his transport and commissariat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alvear, his old colleague in the Spanish
army, had assumed the leading position in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
oligarchy that ruled at Buenos Aires. He suppressed
the triumvirate and placed his relative,
Posadas, at the head of the government. The patriot
armies were besieging Montevideo from the
land side, but it was not until a fighting demon of
an Irish merchant captain, William Brown, had been
placed in command of a few ships which the Buenos
Aireans had gathered, that there was any hope
of reducing the place. This remarkable man was
nearly as important a factor as San Martin himself
in the war against Spain. With incredible audacity
he attacked the Spanish ships wherever he found
them. Numbers and odds made no difference, and
he was never so dangerous as just after an apparent
reverse. His victory of the 14th of June put the
Spanish fleet out of commission; the reduction of
Montevideo followed, as a matter of course; and the
destruction of the Spanish sea power on the Atlantic
side made San Martin's campaign on the Pacific
coast possible.</p>

<p>Civil wars broke out between the Buenos Aires
oligarchy and local military chiefs in the gaucho
provinces and soon hurled Posadas from power. He
was succeeded by Alvear, but the commanders of
the armies refused to recognise the latter's authority
and an insurrection in Buenos Aires itself drove him,
too, into exile. One military dictator succeeded
another, while the provinces more and more ignored
the Buenos Aires pretensions to hegemony. The
frail fabric of the confederation fast crumbled into
fragments. With the end of the Napoleonic wars
re-enforcements began to arrive from Spain, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
royal arms were again victorious and threatened to
wipe out the distracted Republic. Rondeau, one
of the generals who had helped depose Posadas and
Alvear, had been rewarded with command of the
army of the north. Disregarding the experience of
his predecessors, he made the third great effort to
conquer Bolivia and strike at the heart of Spanish
power in Peru by the overland route. His campaign
ended with the crushing defeat at Sipe-Sipe.
Considerable Spanish forces followed him down into
the Argentine plains, but, as San Martin had predicted,
the gaucho cavalry under Gu&euml;mes were able
to keep back their advance.</p>

<p>Belgrano and Rivadavia had been sent to Spain
in 1813 to try to arrange terms on the basis of
autonomy, or the making of Buenos Aires a separate
kingdom under some member of the Spanish
family. They were informed that nothing except
unconditional submission would be accepted, and
they were then ordered to leave Madrid. Scheme
after scheme was presented in Buenos Aires, discussed,
and abandoned. Belgrano wanted to make
a descendant of the Incas emperor of South America.
Others wished to offer submission to Great
Britain in return for a protectorate. The English
government rejected the overtures. A more popular
idea was to elect a monarch from the Portuguese
Braganza family, then reigning in Brazil. The only
definite result of all these confused negotiations was
a formal declaration of independence made on the
9th of July, 1816, by a Congress at which most of
the provinces were represented, and which met in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the city of Tucuman. Many of the members had no
hope of being able to enforce such a declaration.
However, it cleared the way for obtaining foreign
help, and negotiations were continued with a view to
inducing some European prince to accept the throne.</p>

<p>Artigas, the independent military chieftain of
Uruguay and Entre Rios, attacked in 1813 the Missions
to the left of Upper Uruguay which the Rio
Grande Brazilians had seized twelve years before.
He was defeated by the troops of John VI., who
followed him into Uruguay proper and in 1816 captured
Montevideo. Though the Buenos Aireans
had been compelled to concede Uruguay's independence,
this movement excited among them an
intense jealousy of the Portuguese. The scheme
for a Braganza monarch at once became unpopular
and impracticable.</p>

<p>The taciturn general in Cuyo was, however, preparing
a thunderbolt that would clear the Argentine
sky of all these clouds except that most portentous
of all&mdash;civil war. After three years of incessant
preparation, San Martin believed that his army was
ready to undertake the great campaign. Though it
numbered only four thousand men, it was the most
efficient body of troops that ever gathered on South
American soil. Among the Argentine contingent
were the picked youth of Buenos Aires and the provinces&mdash;reckless,
enthusiastic youths whose ambition,
patriotism, or love of adventure made them
willing to follow anywhere San Martin might dare
to lead. Not inferior to their white comrades were
the manumitted negroes. The cruelest charges and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the heaviest losses fell to their lot and few of them
ever returned over the Andes. The Chilean exiles
were picked men&mdash;those who preferred death to
submission, or who had offended so deeply that
their only hope of seeing their homes was to return
sword in hand. This force had been drilled and instructed
in all the art of war as practised during the
Napoleonic era by San Martin himself, a veteran
soldier of the great European campaigns&mdash;one who
had fought with Wellington and against Massena
and Soult. He was indefatigable in attending to
details, and he seems to have foreseen everything.
The last months were spent in preparing rations of
parched corn and dried beef; in gathering mules for
mountain transportation, and in making sledges to
be used on the slopes which were too steep for cannon
on wheels. The most careful calculations were
made of the distances to be traversed; every route
was surveyed; spies were in every pass; the Spaniards
were kept in uncertainty as to which of the
numerous passes along hundreds of miles of frontier
would be used for the attack. San Martin's real
intentions were not revealed by him even to the
members of his staff until the very eve of the advance.</p>

<p>When summer came in 1817, and all the passes
were freed from snow, he was ready. In the middle
of January he broke camp at Mendoza and divided
his army into two divisions. Directly to the west
was the Uspallata Pass, then as now the usual route
between western Argentina and central Chile. Its
Chilean outlet opens into the plain of Aconcagua,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
which is north of Santiago and only separated from
that capital by one transverse spur of the Andes.
Off to the north was the more difficult pass of Patos,
its eastern entrance also easily accessible from Mendoza,
though by a longer detour, and opening at its
other end into the same valley of Aconcagua. The
smaller of the two divisions was to advance over
the Uspallata Pass, so timing its movements as
to reach the open ground of the Aconcagua valley
at the same time as the larger division, which,
under San Martin himself, went to the north around
the Patos route. The Spaniards had a guard at the
summit of the Uspallata Pass, but the advance
troops of the Argentines charged it. Before re-enforcements
could come up, the division was over
and advancing confidently down the ca&ntilde;on on the
Chilean side. Had the Spaniards sent up a force
sufficient to prevent the Uspallata division from debouching
on to the Aconcagua plain it would have
been caught in a trap. The second division could
have bottled it up from below by leaving a small
body at the mouth of the ca&ntilde;on. But before the
Spanish commander had made up his mind what to
do, news came that another army was rapidly coming
down the valley leading into the Aconcagua
valley from the north. Disconcerted by this attack
from an unexpected direction, the Spanish commander
hastened off with an inadequate force to repel
it. He did not reach a defensible point in time; his
vanguard was defeated and he retreated along the
highroad to Santiago, leaving San Martin to reunite
his two divisions at his leisure in the broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Aconcagua plain. Though the army had crossed the
Andes over two of the loftiest and steepest passes
in the world, so admirably had all dispositions been
made that hardly a stop was necessary to refit and
recruit. Artillery and cavalry, as well as infantry,
were ready within four days after reaching the Chilean
side to take up the pursuit of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Marco, the Spanish governor, had not had sufficient
time to concentrate his scattered regiments
since the first news had come that San Martin was
coming in force by the northern passes. Of his five
thousand men only two thousand were able to get
between San Martin's advance and Santiago. The
Argentine general was sure of having the largest
numbers at the point of conflict, but the Spanish
troops were veterans of the Peninsula and were commanded
by a skilful and resolute general. He concentrated
his force in a strong position in a valley
on the south side of the transverse range that separates
Santiago from the Aconcagua valley. He had
hoped to make his stand at the top of the pass, there
four thousand feet high, but San Martin had been
too quick for him. However, the position was admirable
for a stubborn defence. The highroad to
Santiago descended from the pass down a narrow
valley, which, just in front of the Spanish position,
opened into a larger valley running at right angles.
The artillery of the Spaniards commanded the narrow
mouth of the upper valley, and on a side hill
there was room to deploy the infantry and cavalry.
The Argentine troops would be enfiladed in the close
gut before they could form in line of battle. San<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Martin employed the tactics of the Persians at Thermopyl&aelig;.
There was an abandoned road running
over the summit a little to the west of the travelled
route and debouching into the same valley a little
below the Spanish position. Through this O'Higgins,
the chief of San Martin's Chilean allies, at two
o'clock in the morning of February 12th, started
with eighteen hundred men. By eleven he had
reached the main valley and turned up it to attack
the Spaniards on their left flank. His first assault,
made without waiting for the other division to come
down in front, was repulsed. San Martin, sitting on
his war-horse on the heights above, galloped down
the slope, leaving orders to hasten the descent of
the main body. As he reached the lower ground
and joined the Chileans, he saw the head of his
main column appear through the mouth of the pass.
O'Higgins again attacked, and the Spaniards, taken
in flank and with their centre assailed in <i>&eacute;chelon</i> by
the Argentine squadrons and battalions, were at a
hopeless disadvantage. The position of their infantry
was carried by the bayonet, while the patriot
cavalry charged the artillery and sabred the men at
their guns. The infantry were the flower of the
Spanish regulars; they formed a square and for a
time held their stand. Finally, surrounded on
three sides, their artillery gone, and fighting against
double their number, they broke and retreated over
the broken ground in their rear. Less than half
escaped and a quarter were killed on the field and in
the pursuit. The patriots lost only twelve killed and
one hundred and twenty wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the numbers engaged were insignificant,
and though the victory was easily won, the battle
of Chacabuco was decisive in the struggle between
Spain and her revolted subjects in the southern
colonies. Since the outbreak of 1810 the revolutionary
cause had been losing not alone territory
but morale, conviction, and self-confidence. Spanish
authority seemed certain finally to be completely
re-established, perhaps by a compromise and concession
of autonomy, but still on a basis gratifying
to the pride of the mother country. The day before
San Martin started on his march over the
Andes, Chile was quietly submissive; Uruguay was
occupied by Portuguese troops; Argentina was a
mere loose aggregation of discordant and warring
provinces, whose most intelligent statesmen had
nearly given up hope of peace and autonomy, except
by foreign aid or submission to some alien
monarch. But the day after Chacabuco the Spanish
governor was flying from Santiago to the coast;
Chile had become, and has remained, independent.
In Argentina there was no more talk of Portuguese
princes, of British protectorates, of compromise with
Spain. The declaration of Tucuman had become a
reality. There was much more hard fighting still to
be done, and time after time during the next seven
years the final result seemed to tremble in the
balance, but hope and national spirit had been so
aroused in South America that defeat was never
irremediable.</p>

<p>The rest of San Martin's military career belongs
rather to the history of Chile and Peru than to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of Argentina. It is enough to say that he established
his friend O'Higgins as dictator of Chile, thus
assuring her co-operation in the prosecution of the
war against Peru. Spanish successes in Chile and
civil war in Argentina delayed for years his overmatching
the Spanish naval power on the Pacific.
Without command of the sea he would have had to
march his army up a desert coast between the Cordillera
and the ocean&mdash;an undertaking almost impossible.
The help of the Buenos Aires fleet was
essential and so was the aid of the Argentine treasury
in buying more ships and paying foreign seamen.
His friends at Buenos Aires were struggling for their
lives against their rivals for supreme power. To San
Martin's demand for assistance they responded by
begging him first to use his army to crush the rebellion.
That he refused them in their hour of bitter
need has been pointed out as a blot upon his fame,
but his resolution was Spartan. Not even the considerations
of gratitude to personal friends diverted
him from his great purpose. He had that element
of supremely great achievement&mdash;steadfastness to
adhere to a purpose once conceived that nothing
could shake. Puerreyedon might be driven into
exile; the warring factions might tear Argentina
into fragments, and jealous Cochrane might unjustly
accuse him; the ambitious and selfish Bol&iacute;var might
regard him only as an obstacle to his own supremacy;
none of these things could change his course
or alter his devotion to the one great purpose of his
life.</p>

<p>In 1820 he finally started up the coast, and in four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
months, without a pitched battle, he had rendered
the Spanish position on the coast of Peru untenable.
He met Bol&iacute;var at Guayaquil, and the personal interview
between the liberators of the northern and
southern halves of South America was the end of
San Martin's public career. He went to it with the
purpose of arranging a joint campaign to drive the
Spanish from their last stronghold, the highlands of
Peru. But Bol&iacute;var did not see his own way clear to
co-operation. San Martin explained his predicament
to no one; he uttered no word of complaint or regret;
he simply gave up the command of the army
which he had led for seven years and resigned the
Dictatorship of Peru. There was no place for him
in distracted Argentina except as a leader in the
civil wars&mdash;a r&ocirc;le he disdained. He went into exile
without saying a word as to the reasons for his
action. Rather than precipitate a division between
the patriots before the last Spaniard had been driven
from South America, he submitted in silence to the
reproach of cowardice. Rather than jeopard independence
he sacrificed home, money, honours, even
reputation itself. The history of the world records
few examples of finer civic virtue.</p>

<p>The rest of his life he spent poverty-stricken in
Paris. Only once he tried to return to his native
country. At Montevideo he heard that Buenos
Aires was in the throes of another revolution and
that his presence might be misconstrued. Without
a word, he took the next ship back to Europe. For
many years his struggles against poverty and ill-health
were pathetic. It was the generosity of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Spaniard, and not a fellow-countryman, that relieved
the last days of his life. But throughout those
weary thirty years he never wavered in his devotion
to South America. His last utterance about public
affairs was a vehement laudation of Rosas&mdash;tyrant
though he thought him&mdash;because the latter had
defied France and England when they disregarded
Argentina's rights as a sovereign member of the
family of nations.</p>

<p>Reading was the only resource left to lighten his
old age, and his last months were embittered by
the approach of blindness. His heart began to be
affected, symptoms of an aneurism appeared, and
he went to Boulogne to take the sea air. Standing
one day on the beach he felt the awful shock of pain
that announced his approaching end. "Gasping and
raising his hand to his heart, he turned with a touching
smile to that daughter who ever followed him like
a latter-day Antigone, and said, '<i>C'est l'orage qui
mene au port</i>.' On the 17th of August, 1850, being
seventy-two years of age, he expired in the arms of
his beloved daughter. Chile and Argentina have
raised him statues; Peru has decreed a monument
to his memory. The Argentine nation, at last one
and united as he had ever desired, has brought back
his sacred remains and celebrated his apotheosis.
To-day his tomb may be seen in the metropolitan
cathedral, bearing witness for Argentina to his just
distinction as the greatest of all her men of action."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE ERA OF CIVIL WARS</h3>


<p>For half a century, from 1812 to 1862, the story
of Argentina is one of almost continual civil
wars, of disturbances, and armed revolutions affecting
every part of the Republic. But through the
confused records of this half-century there runs
the thread of a steady tendency and purpose. The
nation was instinctively seeking to establish an
equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal
forces, between the spirit of local autonomy and the
necessity for union. At the same time, the irrepressible
conflict between military and civil principles
of government was fought out. Argentina
emerged strong and united, while the provinces retained
the right of local self-government, and the
military classes were relegated to their proper subordinate
position as servants of the civil and industrial
interests of the community. When studied in
detail the story of the civil wars is confusing and
tedious: it is my purpose to omit all that does not
bear on the final rational and beneficent result.</p>

<p>At the outset of the revolution against Spain, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
oligarchy of liberals who ruled Buenos Aires assumed
the sovereignty of the whole Viceroyalty. They
regarded themselves as successors to the power of
the Viceroy himself, and attempted to rule the outlying
provinces with no more regard for the latter's
interests than if they had been delegates of an absolute
monarch. Though the people of the city of
Buenos Aires often quarrelled as to what individual
should exercise the supreme power, they were united
in insisting that the capital should continue to enjoy
the privileges and exclusive commercial rights with
which the Spanish system had endowed it. Hardly
had the revolution begun when the districts in the
neighbourhood of Buenos Aires showed symptoms
of revolt against the central authorities. The cities
of Santa F&eacute;, Concepcion, and Corrientes, each with
its dependent territory, aspired to the status of
independent provinces. Military chieftains, called
"caudillos," organised the gauchos, who were excellent
cavalry ready-made to their hands, and defied
the Buenos Aires oligarchy. Jos&eacute; Artigas, a fierce
chieftain of the plains on the Lower Uruguay,
gathered about him a considerable army from among
the gauchos east of the Paran&aacute;, and did more than
the Buenos Aireans themselves to shut up the Spaniards
in the fortress of Montevideo. He refused to
accept the concessions offered by the Buenos Aires
oligarchy, and a desperate civil war broke out.
Buenos Aires successively lost Uruguay, Entre
Rios, Corrientes, and Santa F&eacute;. The fighting was
bloody and these districts were all terribly devastated.
Cordoba and the Andean provinces also re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>fused
to recognise the validity of orders emanating
from Buenos Aires. By the year 1818 all the provinces
were practically independent of Buenos Aires,
though the latter abated not a jot of her pretensions
to hegemony, and continued to send troops against
the various caudillos. Her armies obeyed their own
generals rather than the orders of the central government.
In desperation the oligarchy finally peremptorily
ordered San Martin and Belgrano to bring
down their armies from the western and northern
frontiers and suppress the independent chiefs. San
Martin refused to obey, but the imaginative, warm-hearted
Belgrano was not made of the same sterling
stuff. He managed to lead the army of the north
as far as the province of Cordoba, but at Arequito
the troops, at the instigation of ambitious officers,
revolted and scattered. Many joined the caudillos,
and on the 1st of February the provincials completely
overthrew the Buenos Aires militia in the decisive
battle of Cepeda.</p>

<p>This ended for a time the capital's pretensions to
hegemony. Decentralisation went on apace. Cuyo
dissolved into the three provinces of Mendoza, San
Luiz, and San Juan; the old intendencia of Salta
became four new provinces,&mdash;Santiago del Estero,
Tucuman, Catamarca, and Salta,&mdash;to which a fifth
was added when the city of Jujuy erected itself into
a separate jurisdiction in 1834. From the Cordoba
of colonial times Rioja split off, while the intendencia
of Buenos Aires had been divided into four great
provinces, Santa F&eacute;, Corrientes, Entre Rios, and
Buenos Aires, besides the independent nation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Uruguay. Each of these provinces practically corresponded
with the leading city and its dependent
territory, and the Cabildo of each municipality was
the basis of new local government.</p>

<p>This process was spontaneous, and the provinces
then formed have ever since been the units of the
Argentine confederation. To many intelligent patriots
of the time, however, decentralisation seemed
to be only a sure sign of swiftly approaching
anarchy. Power fell more and more into the hands
of the military leaders, and war became almost the
normal condition of the country. During the four
years from 1820 to 1824, there was no material
change in the position of the contending forces.
The provinces much desired to make a confederation
of which Buenos Aires should be an equal member,
but the latter refused and only waited for an opportunity
in order to renew her pretensions to hegemony.</p>

<p>Two opposing tendencies were, however, at work
which soon created two parties within the walls of
Buenos Aires itself. Commercial interests had suffered
so severely in the civil wars, and communications
were so uncertain and so burdened with
arbitrary exactions by the provincials, that the property-holding
classes began to press hard upon the
office-holders of the oligarchy with demands for an
accommodation and some sort of a union with the
provinces. This was the beginning of the federalist
party, which naturally found efficient support among
the cattle-herding inhabitants on the great pampas
of the province of Buenos Aires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the unitarians were becoming
more compact, more determined, and more definite
in their purposes. Rivadavia, the greatest constructive
statesman of the era, undertook the reform of
the laws and the administration. He created the
University of Buenos Aires; founded hospitals and
asylums; introduced ecclesiastical and military reform;
bettered the land laws, and infused into the
legislation a modern spirit. The improved tone
of political thought tended to stimulate a more
general and rational discussion of a <i>modus vivendi</i>
with the provinces. The federalists favoured the
establishment of a system like that of the United
States, while the unitarians clung to the idea of a
nation organised more after the model of the French
Republic.</p>

<p>In 1825 the provinces were represented at a general
constituent congress which assembled in Buenos
Aires. After much discussion the unitarians, with
Rivadavia at their head, finally obtained control.
In 1826 he was elected executive chief of the federation.
This election, however, did not make him
president in fact. Recognition from the Cabildos
and the caudillos was practically of greater importance
than the vote of a congress of delegates who
were unable to insure the acquiescence of their constituencies.
Rivadavia's favourite plan of placing
the city of Buenos Aires directly under the control
of the central government excited bitter opposition
among the federalists of Buenos Aires. Under their
leader, Manuel Dorrego, they protested vehemently
against the dismemberment of their home province.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the crazy fabric was subjected to the
strain of a serious foreign war. In 1825 the country
districts of Uruguay rose against their Brazilian
rulers. The Argentines went wild with joy when
they heard of the victory which the gauchos
won over the imperial forces at Sarandi. Congress
promptly decreed that Uruguay had reunited herself
to the confederation. The Emperor's answer
was a declaration of war and a blockade of Buenos
Aires. The fighting Irish sailor, Admiral William
Brown, again came to the front, and his daring seamanship
rendered the Brazilian blockade ineffective.
He destroyed a large division of their fleet at the
battle of Juncal, while fast Baltimore clippers, commanded
by English and Yankee privateer captains,
swept Brazilian commerce from the seas. Late in
1826 an Argentine army of eight thousand men was
assembled for the invasion of Rio Grande do Sul.
Alvear, now returned from exile, was entrusted with
its command, and on the 20th of February, 1827,
the Brazilians were overwhelmingly defeated at Ituzaingo,
far within their own boundary. The Argentines
were not able to follow up their victory,
and shortly returned to Uruguayan territory, but
the Emperor was never again able to undertake an
aggressive campaign. Negotiations for peace were
begun, and Rivadavia's envoy signed a treaty by
which Uruguay was to remain a part of the empire
of Brazil. A storm of indignation broke forth at
Buenos Aires, and Rivadavia had to disavow his minister
and continue the war. The blow to his prestige
was, however, mortal; the federalists had, indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
never ceased to make war against him; and the unitarian
constitution which Congress had adopted at
his dictation was rejected unanimously by the provinces.
He resigned, and Dorrego, chief of the unitarians,
succeeded him as nominal executive chief
of the confederation. In reality, however, the Republic
was divided into five quasi-independent
military states. Dorrego ruled in Buenos Aires,
Lopez in Santa F&eacute;, Ibarra in Santiago, Bustos in
Cordoba, and Quiroga in Cuyo.</p>

<p>Many of the officers of the army which had been
victorious at Ituzaingo were dissatisfied with the
triumph of Dorrego at Buenos Aires. They belonged
to the unitarian party, and they were anxious
themselves to usurp the places of the various caudillos.
The first division that reached Buenos Aires
after the signing of the preliminary peace with Brazil
raised the standard of rebellion in the city itself.
General Lavalle declared himself Governor, while
Dorrego fled to the interior, only to be pursued,
captured, and shot, without the form of trial, by
Lavalle's personal order. This began the fiercest
and bloodiest civil war which ever desolated the
Argentine. The gauchos of the southern provinces
rose <i>en masse</i> to fight the unitarian regulars, while
the generals of the latter began a series of campaigns
against all the federalist provincial governments and
caudillos. General Paz advanced on Cordoba to
give battle to Bustos, while Lavalle's forces invaded
Santa F&eacute;. Rosas, the chief of southern Buenos
Aires, had rallied the federalists of that province.
He himself joined Lopez, the caudillo of Santa F&eacute;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
while he left behind a considerable force of his
gauchos to threaten the city from the south. Lavalle
sent some of his best regiments against the
latter body, but to his surprise his veterans were
completely cut to pieces by the fierce riders of the
plains. He himself had to retreat to Buenos Aires,
while Rosas and Lopez defeated him under the very
walls of the city.</p>

<p>These victories made the Buenos Aires federalist
leader, Juan Manuel Rosas, the chief figure in Argentine
affairs. Thenceforth, for more than twenty
years, he was the absolute dictator and tyrant of
Buenos Aires. The most bitterly hated man in
Argentine history, probably no other leader had as
profound an influence in preparing the Argentine
nation for the consolidation which was so shortly to
follow his own fall from power. His personal characteristics
and his public career are equally interesting.
The scion of a wealthy Buenos Aires family,
from his childhood he devoted himself to cattle-raising
on the vast family estates of the southern
pampas. He became the model and idol of the
gauchos. By the time he was twenty-five, he was
the acknowledged king of the southern pampas, with
a thousand hard-riding, half-savage horsemen obeying
his orders. In 1820 he and his regiment were
chief factors in the revolution that placed General
Rodriguez in power at Buenos Aires. Through the
more peaceful years that followed, his power grew
until he was the acknowledged head of the country
people of Buenos Aires province and their champion
against the city.  He had been fairly well educated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
his information was wide, and his intellectual abilities
were of a high order. But he thoroughly identified
his tastes and prejudices with those of his rude
followers, and in politics he was fiercely unitarian.
The victories of 1829 over Lavalle placed him in
supreme power at Buenos Aires and made him the
nominal head of the whole Argentine.</p>

<p>His real power was, however, far from extending
over the whole territory. General Paz with his
veterans of the Brazilian war had expelled Bustos
from Cordoba and firmly established himself as ruler
of that province. Quiroga, the redoubtable caudillo
of the Cuyo province, gathered his swarms of fierce
gauchos from the western pampas in the slopes of
the Andes, and descended to the very walls of Cordoba,
there to be twice defeated with awful slaughter
by General Paz. The latter followed up his victories
by establishing unitarian governments in the north-western
provinces. In Cuyo he was not so successful,
and Quiroga managed to sustain himself. Rosas
came to the rescue of the despairing federalists with
the whole force of Buenos Aires. In that province
all opposition to him had been crushed and he was
able to send a strong army against Cordoba which
surprised and captured General Paz himself. This
misfortune demoralised the unitarians. The federalists
and the terrible Quiroga again triumphed in
most of the western provinces. It is estimated that
more than twenty-three thousand unitarians fell in
battle. Part of Paz's army retired to Tucuman and
were there surrounded by an overwhelming force
under Quiroga. Though their position was hopeless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
they did not offer to surrender, nor would quarter
have been given them had they asked it. In
these internecine conflicts, the beaten side usually
fought it out to the last man, selling their lives as
dearly as possible. Five hundred prisoners taken
at Tucuman were shot in cold blood, and only a few
small bands escaped to Bolivia.</p>

<p>Rosas filled the offices in the provinces with his
partisans, while the obsequious authorities of the
capital conferred upon him the high-sounding title,
"Restorer of the Laws." He made a feint or two
of resigning the governorship, and in fact left it in
other hands while he led an army against the Indians
of the South. He soon returned with the
prestige of having extended white domination far
beyond its former boundaries. After much show
of reluctance, in 1835 he accepted the title of Governor
and Captain-General, and a special statute expressly
confided to him the whole "sum of the public
power."</p>

<p>The thousands of murders, betrayals, and treasons
of the long civil wars had sapped the foundations of
good faith in human kindness. The unitarians were
mere outlaws, their property was constantly subject
to confiscation, and their lives were never safe.
Rosas himself, least of all, could confide in the faithfulness
of his partisans. Things had come to such
a pass that no one could rule except by force.
Whoever was in power was sure to be hated by the
majority and plotted against by many, though he
might have been raised to command by the acclamation
of the whole population. Rosas was a product<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of the conditions that surrounded him. Belgrano,
Rivadavia, and every one who had tried to establish
a civil government had failed. The forces of militarism
and federalism had been too strong for them.
From among the ambitious military chieftains the
strongest and fittest survived. Rosas understood
the conditions under which he held power and took
the measures his experience had taught him would
be most effective in preserving it. He undertook to
forestall revolt by creating a reign of terror; he replaced
the blue and white of Buenos Aires by red&mdash;the
colour of his own faction; the wearing of a scrap
of blue was considered proof of treason. A club of
desperadoes, called the Massorca, was formed of
men sworn to do his bidding, even though it might
be to murder their own relatives. No one suspected
of disaffection was safe for a day. Sometimes a
warning was given so that the victim might flee,
leaving his property to be confiscated; sometimes
he was dragged from his bed and stabbed. The
charge of deliberate bloodthirstiness against Rosas
is, however, hardly borne out by the facts. For
political reasons he did not hesitate to kill, and to
kill cruelly, but he did not kill for the mere sake of
killing.</p>

<p>He was passionately jealous of foreign interference.
Early in his reign he quarrelled with the
government of France over questions in regard to
the domicile and obligations of foreign residents.
The French fleet, assisted later by that of Great
Britain, blockaded Buenos Aires. But Rosas defied
their combined power; although in this very year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
(1835) he was menaced by a formidable invasion
from the banished unitarians. In Uruguay the
"colorados" occupied Montevideo and had formed
a close alliance with the Argentine exiles. Montevideo
was the centre of resistance to Rosas and from
its walls went out expeditions to end the revolts
which continually broke forth. In 1842 the allied
unitarians and colorados suffered a great defeat from
Rosas's right arm in the field, General Urquiza, and
thenceforth Oribe, chief of the Uruguayan "blancos"
besieged the colorados in Montevideo and controlled
the country districts. This apparently ended
all hope of expelling Rosas from power. The emigration
of the intelligent and high-spirited youth of
Buenos Aires to Montevideo and Chile increased.
Among these exiles and martyrs to their devotion
to constitutional government were many Argentines
who shortly rose to the top in politics and whose
abilities gave a great impulse to the intellectual
movement. Among them were Mitre, Vicente
Lopez, Sarmiento, Valera, and Echeverria, who
share the honour of establishing civil government in
Buenos Aires, and who aided Urquiza in preventing
South America from becoming a military empire, and
in uniting the Argentine province into a stable nation.</p>

<span class="caption">BUENOS AIRES IN 1845.<br />

</div>

<p>The longer the tyrant reigned, the less men remembered
their own factional divisions. Practically
the whole civil population of the capital was ready
to support a rebellion. Rosas, however, was to
fall, not by a revolution in Buenos Aires, but because
his system was inconsistent with the local
autonomy of the provinces. He put his partisans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>into power as military governors, but no bond was
strong enough to keep them faithful to his interests.
As soon as they were well established in their satrapies,
they became jealous of their own prerogatives
and of the rights of their people. Rosas ceased to
be a real federalist when he made Buenos Aires the
centre of his power. He lived there, he raised most
of his revenue there, and the city's interests became
in a sense synonymous with his own. He excluded
foreigners from the provinces, he forbade direct communication
between the banks of the Paran&aacute; and
Uruguay and the outside world. Everything was
required to be trans-shipped at Buenos Aires so that
it might be subject to duty.</p>

<p>The chief lieutenant of Rosas was General Urquiza,
whom he had appointed governor of Entre Rios.
The latter's generalship overcame the unitarian rebellions
in that province and repelled the invasions
from Uruguay. Under his wise and moderate rule
the province flourished and recovered from the
devastations of the previous civil wars. Its fertile
plains were covered with magnificent herds of cattle
and horses, which fed and mounted an admirable
cavalry. Urquiza himself was the greatest rancher
in the province and could raise an army from his own
estates. Entrenched between the vast-moving floods
of the Uruguay and Paraguay, he was practically
safe from attack, and his relations with his neighbours
in Corrientes, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil
were those of warm friendship and alliance, as soon
as he had declared against the tyrant, who, seated
at the mouth of the Plate, cut off the countries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
above from free access to the sea. Though Urquiza
was a caudillo he had no such ambition for supreme
power as plagued Rosas. He was even-tempered,
of simple tastes, and careless of military glory.</p>

<p>In 1846 the rupture between him and Rosas came,
and thenceforth he devoted himself to the overthrow
of the tyrant. Three times his attacks failed; but,
in 1851, he arranged an alliance with Brazil and
with the colorado faction in Uruguay. The war was
opened by Urquiza's crossing the Uruguay and, in
conjunction with a Brazilian army, suddenly falling
upon the blancos, who, in alliance with Rosas, were
besieging Montevideo. Most of the defeated forces
joined his army, and accompanied by his Brazilian
and Uruguayan allies he recrossed the Uruguay and
moved over the Entre Rios plains to a point on the
Paran&aacute; just at the head of the delta. The Brazilian
fleet penetrated up the river to protect his crossing,
and on the 24th of December the entire force of
twenty-four thousand men, the largest which up to
that time had ever assembled in South America, was
safely over and encamped on the dry pampas of
Santa F&eacute;. The road to Buenos Aires was open.
Rosas could do nothing but wait there and trust all
to the result of a single battle. On the 3rd of February
he was crushingly defeated in the battle of
Caseros, fought within a few miles of the city. Of
the twenty thousand men he led into action half
proved treacherous, and many of his principal officers
betrayed him. He took refuge at the British Legation,
and thence was sent on board a man-of-war
which carried him into exile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>CONSOLIDATION</h3>


<p>After forty years of struggle no formula had
been found which would satisfy the aspirations
for local self-government and at the same time
secure the external union so essential to the welfare
of the whole country. The questions between the
provinces and Buenos Aires, and between the different
cities which were rivals in the race for national
leadership, seemed to a superficial glance to be as far
as ever from solution. There had, however, been a
shifting of the material balance of power which was
soon to change the situation. The provinces had
suffered most severely from the long civil wars.
Corrientes was well-nigh a desert, in Santa F&eacute; the
Indians roamed up to the gates of the capital town,
and the Andean provinces were isolated and poor.
The long peace under Rosas's rule had increased
the wealth and population of Buenos Aires. The
city lost hundreds of enthusiastic young liberals,
but it gained thousands who fled from the disorders
of the interior. Its population had doubled since
his accession. Thirty thousand English, Irish, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Scotch had crowded in to engage in sheep-raising,
and the rural population of Buenos Aires province
was nearly two hundred thousand. City and country
together had doubled, while the rest of the confederation
had only increased one-half. The capital
province now contained twenty-seven per cent. of
the total population, and the disproportion in wealth
and percentage of foreigners was far greater. The
number of sheep increased from two and a half million
in 1830 to five times that number, and by 1850
there were eight million cattle and three million
horses in the single province.</p>

<p>All over the country rational ideas about government
had made progress. The people were
thoroughly sickened of military rule. Civilisation,
education, and general intelligence were spreading
their beneficent influences; industry, commerce, and
the pursuit of wealth were absorbing more of the
national energies.</p>

<p>Urquiza, greatest of the caudillos, saw that without
peace and union Entre Rios could not be insured
prosperity. He had no sooner entered Buenos Aires
than he took measures looking to the framing and
adoption of a federal constitution. After his victory
he was named provisional director of the confederation,
but he showed no wish to play the r&ocirc;le
of a Rosas. All the governors met and agreed to
the calling of a Constituent Congress, in which each
province was to have an equal vote. As a further
precaution against the predominance of Buenos
Aires the session was to be held in Santa F&eacute;. The
provinces were anxious to form a strong federation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and the only opposition came from Buenos Aires.
Her statesmen did not realise that she was bound
to be the centre of the system and that the pull
of her superior mass would, before many years, be
sufficient to control the aberrations of the satellites.
Though the governor of Buenos Aires had agreed
on behalf of his province, and though Urquiza's
military power was overwhelming, the legislature of
that province refused its assent. It was clear that
Buenos Aires and the other provinces would not be
able to agree upon a basis of union. The ambitious
cities of the interior each aspired to take the place
of Buenos Aires as the capital, and to this humiliation
the latter city would never submit unless after
another civil war.</p>

<p>Urquiza determined not to use force, and retired
to his ranch. As soon as he was out of sight, the
city rose in arms against his nominees. The broad-minded
Entre Rios chieftain sent back word that he
had won the battle of Caseros for the sole purpose
of giving Buenos Aires her liberty and that he would
not now intervene to prevent her making the use of
it she chose. He even disbanded his troops. However,
when the Buenos Aireans marched an army to
the attack of Santa F&eacute; where the Constituent Congress,
attended by delegates from all the other provinces,
was holding its sessions, he again took the
field. A counter-revolution broke out in the rural
districts of the Buenos Aires province against the
faction dominant in the city. Urquiza joined his
forces to theirs and besieged the town. A land
siege was useless without a blockade on the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
side, and Urquiza tried to establish one. He was
unsuccessful because the commanders of his ships
treacherously betrayed him, surrendering to the city
party for a heavy bribe. He raised the siege and
retired to the northern provinces.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires virtually declared her independence
of the other provinces by this action, but the latter
took no further steps to force her into their union.
Urquiza and his followers had, however, accomplished
more toward uniting the Argentine into a
firmly knit nation than had been done in the previous
forty years. The opposition of Buenos Aires
helped convince the other provinces of the necessity
of a union. With the mouth of the river in the
hands of a hostile state more powerful than any
one of them separately, the position of Entre Rios,
Santa F&eacute;, or any one of the others, would have been
critical. Only by uniting could they hope to maintain
themselves and avoid absorption in detail. Intelligent
Argentines had long been convinced of the
desirability of a firm and enduring union, and the
present danger crystallised that conviction in men's
minds. Back of all this was Urquiza's influence.
At last a military chief had come to the possession
of supreme power who was willing to aid his country
in establishing a stable and free government, and
whose purpose was not merely the gratification of
his own love of power. Argentine writers are divided
in their opinion of Urquiza's real abilities, and many
think that ignorance and irresolution, rather than a
lofty patriotism, caused his moderation after his victory
over Rosas. Intelligent foreigners, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
who saw the Plate for themselves during this
period are unanimous in praising his character, his
dignified bearing, his liberality, and his capacities.
Argentina had passed the stage when a military dictator
was her natural chief. The day for constitutional
government had arrived; Urquiza was a
product of his time, and consciously or unconsciously
embodied the changed political sentiments
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, 1853, the Constituent Congress
adopted a constitution substantially copied
from that of the United States of North America&mdash;and
that constitution, with a few amendments, has
continued to be the fundamental law of the Argentine
Republic. The navigation of the Paran&aacute; and
the Uruguay was declared free to all the world,
largely as a reward to Brazil for her assistance
against Rosas, although she protested against the
extension of that liberty to any nations except those
who had territory on the banks. The city of Paran&aacute;,
in the province of Entre Rios and on the eastern
shore of the Paran&aacute; River, was made temporary
capital of the Republic. The various provincial
capitals had been unable to agree that any one of
them should have the honour and profit of being the
political metropolis, and the city of Buenos Aires
was selected as the permanent capital, to become
such as soon as the province of that name should
enter the confederation. The delegates had a
double purpose in making this selection. Buenos
Aires was the natural commercial and political
centre, and, all things considered, the most con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>venient
location in the provinces. In the second
place, they desired to weaken the great province of
Buenos Aires by cutting it in two, and to curb the
city's political influence by placing it directly under
the control of the federal government.</p>

<p>Urquiza was naturally selected as the first President,
and was recognised by foreign nations. Buenos
Aires protested, claiming still to be, for international
purposes, the Argentine nation. She did not, however,
formally declare her independence and seek for
recognition as a new power. Buenos Aires, as well
as the confederation, looked forward to the time
when she would join the latter. Throughout
Urquiza's six-year term, the provinces prospered
amazingly. His administration of his province had
guaranteed the security of property, and now as
President he extended the blessings of peace to
much of the rest of the confederation. The new
bonds sat lightly on the outlying provinces of the
Andean regions, but Urquiza did not stretch his
constitutional authority to interfere with them, satisfied
to let them learn by degrees that the right of
local self-government guaranteed by the paper constitution
would be respected in practice. The freedom
of navigation caused unprecedented prosperity
in the river provinces. The towns on the Paran&aacute;
and Uruguay doubled in population during his six-years'
service. Corrientes had been continually
ravaged by the civil wars as lately as the last few
years of Rosas's reign, but the assurance of peace
was all that was needed to start the rebuilding of
the houses and the restocking of the ranches. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
impulse in population, wealth, and commerce then
given to the river provinces has never since lost
its force. Foreign capital and immigration were
invited and the rivers and harbours carefully surveyed.
Rosario, in Santa F&eacute;, was made a port of
entry and began a growth that has made it second
only to Buenos Aires itself.</p>

<p>In Buenos Aires events were gradually shaping
themselves toward reuniting that province with the
confederation. A liberal provincial constitution
was adopted, and though the ruling bureaucracy
preferred the <i>statu quo</i>, fearing that their own fall
from power would follow any triumph of the provincials,
they were unable to hold the city in check.
It was too evident that the real interests of the city,
and even her future commercial supremacy, were
menaced by a continuance of the separation. In
1859 the situation became so strained that Buenos
Aires marched an army to attack the federal government.
Urquiza met it near the borders of Santa F&eacute;
and Buenos Aires, and administered a defeat. He
advanced to the city and required his vanquished
opponents to agree to accept the constitution of
1853, and to consent that Buenos Aires should become
a member of the confederation. He yielded,
however, to the wishes of many Buenos Aireans
and consented in the interests of harmony, that the
question of the dismembering of the city from the
province and capitalising the former should remain
open for future determination. The essential justice
in all other respects of the constitution of 1853 had
long been admitted even in Buenos Aires and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
remained no reason why the latter should not enter
the confederation once and for all. On the 21st of
October, 1860, General Bartolom&eacute; Mitre, Governor
of Buenos Aires, swore to the constitution, saying:
"This is the permanent organic law, the real expression
of the perpetual union of the members of the
Argentine family, so long separated by civil war and
bloodshed."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Urquiza's term had expired. Dr.
Derqui, his successor, was suspected of designs
against the autonomy of the provincial governments.
The assassination of the Governor of San Juan and
the succession of a member of an opposite faction,
was made the occasion for Federal intervention in
the affairs of that province. The government of
Buenos Aires protested and it became evident that
this untoward event was soon to disturb the peace
of the newly formed confederation. The Federal
Congress, under Derqui influence, refused to admit
the members from Buenos Aires. Mitre marched
out at the head of her forces and at the battle of
Pavon, September 17, 1861, he overthrew the provincial
forces. Buenos Aires remained mistress of
the situation. The governments of certain provinces
had been imposed on their people by the Derqui
administration, or they were obnoxious to the
triumphant Buenos Aires party. They were overthrown
and Derqui was deposed. Happily for the
Argentine, Mitre was a sincere patriot and, though
young, was moderate and conciliatory. Made president
of the republic as the representative of the
victorious Buenos Aireans, he set about the final<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reorganisation of constitutional government in a
spirit of unselfishness and with a foresight and skill
that greatly aided to save his country from the
sterilising anarchy of civil war.</p>

<p>The accession of Mitre in 1862 marked the end of
the period of uncertainty. The government of the
Argentine Republic was now finally and definitely
established and fixed, after fifty-two years of conflict.
The constitution of 1853 was left unamended,
except that Buenos Aires became the seat of federal
government without being separated from its province
or ceasing to be the provincial capital. The
free international navigation of the rivers was not
interfered with, and Buenos Aires abandoned her
pretensions to special commercial privileges. She
was thenceforward more and more the centre of
gravitation and power for the whole republic, but
her influence came from legitimate natural causes
and was exercised within constitutional limits. The
autonomy of the provinces was not interfered with,
and it was no longer possible, even in the remotest
districts, for a caudillo to rally at his call the gauchos,
always ready for a raid, a campaign, or an
invasion.</p>

<span class="caption">BARTOLOM&Eacute; MITRE.<br />
[From a steel engraving.]</span>
</div>

<p>Though the form of the federal government was
fixed and its theoretical supremacy has never since
been questioned, its real power at first was feeble.
Urquiza was master in the mesopotamian provinces,
and in case of need Mitre could count on little military
help except from his own province. The only
result of the battle of Pavon which was immediately
apparent was the shifting of the centre of power
from Urquiza's capital to Buenos Aires. Nevertheless,
henceforth the tendency was constantly toward
strengthening the bonds of union.  Urquiza and the
other provincial governors showed no disposition to
attack the central authority, and in turn the latter
was careful to avoid useless aggressions against them.
The problem of reconciling provincial rights with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>existence of an adequate federal government had at
last been solved. The nation passed on to a still
more difficult question,&mdash;the smooth and satisfactory
working of democratic representative institutions
in the absence of an effective participation in
public affairs on the part of the bulk of the population.
Elections have not carried the prestige of
being the expression of the majority will. The ruling
classes have been anxious enough to obey the
popular voice and to govern wisely, but people can
only gradually be trained into the habit of expressing
their will clearly and indisputably at regular
elections. The insignificant disturbances to public
order which have occurred since 1862 have been
indications of dissatisfaction with the imperfect detail
workings of the complicated system of ascertaining
the popular wishes, or hasty protests against
mistakes on the part of those in power. Never
have they endangered the Federal constitution nor
diverted the steady course of the nation's progress
in the art of self-government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE MODERN ARGENTINE</h3>


<p>General Mitre's administration is memorable
for the beginning of that tremendous
industrial development which in thirty years made
Argentina, in proportion to population, the greatest
exporting country in the world. Foreign capital
and immigration were chief factors in the transformation
that within a few decades changed an
isolated and industrially backward community into
a nation possessing all the appliances and luxuries
of the most advanced material civilisation.</p>

<p>In 1865 circumstances forced Mitre into the Paraguayan
war. Lopez, the Paraguayan dictator, hated
the Buenos Aireans quite as much as he did the
Brazilians with whom he was constantly quarrelling,
and he was only awaiting a favourable opportunity
to vent his dislike on either or both. He counted
on the coolness that naturally existed between Urquiza
and Mitre to insure him the former's aid.
In 1864 Brazil intervened in the affairs of Uruguay
by assisting one of the parties in the civil war then
raging. Lopez regarded the action of Brazil as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
endangering the balance of power in the Plate regions.
In retaliation he seized the Brazilian province
of Matto Grosso, which lay along the Paraguay north
of his own territory. Mitre wished to remain neutral,
although he had no sympathy with the brutal
despot, and had an understanding about Brazil's
action in Uruguay which safeguarded the interests
of Argentina. Lopez, however, insolently demanded
free passage across Argentine territory for
the troops which he wished to send against Brazil
and Uruguay. Mitre's refusal was followed by a
Paraguayan invasion, and national honour required
that this violation of territory be resented. Brazil
and the Flores faction in Uruguay welcomed the
alliance of Argentina. The Paraguayan invasion
was repulsed by their combined forces, and the allies
advanced up the Paran&aacute; against Lopez in his own
dominions. It was natural that Mitre should be
commander-in-chief of the allied armies, although
Brazil furnished the bulk of the troops and bore the
brunt of the expense. Urquiza disappointed Lopez
in refusing to revolt against Buenos Aires, and although
he took no great personal interest in the war
he co-operated in many ways with Mitre.</p>

<p>The enormous expenditures of the Brazilian government
furnished a splendid cash market for Argentine
stock and produce, and the resulting profits
compensated for the pecuniary sacrifices involved.
In two years' fighting both the Argentine and the
Brazilian armies suffered tremendous losses on the
field and in the cholera hospitals. After the great
repulse at Curupayty in 1867 the number of Argen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>tine
troops was largely reduced. When the Brazilian
fleet finally forced the passage of the river, opening
the way to Asuncion, Mitre resigned the command
into the hands of the Brazilian general Caxias, and
the last two years of the war were carried on principally
by Brazilian troops. By the peace of 1870
Argentina's title to certain valuable territory was
quieted, and she gained an important commercial advantage
by the opening of Paraguay to her trade.
Her commercial and industrial leadership in the
Plate valley has never since been endangered. Politically
also the indirect results were gratifying.
The tremendous sacrifices in men and money had
sickened the Brazilian government and people of
foreign complications. Thereafter, the emperor
pursued a policy of non-interference, which has left
to his Spanish neighbours a free hand among themselves.
With the withdrawal of the Brazilian troops
from Paraguay, the balance of political power began
slowly to pass from Rio to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Sarmiento, the "schoolmaster president," succeeded
Mitre in 1868. His election is said to have
been the freest and most peaceful ever held in the
republic and to have represented as nearly as any
the will of the electors. The development of population,
wealth, and industry continued in increasing
geometrical proportion. During forty-five years
before 1857 the population had only a little more
than doubled; during the forty-five years since that
date, the increase has been four hundred and fifty
per cent. The yearly increment holds fairly steady
at four per cent., which is as large as that of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
country in the world. In 1869 the city of Buenos
Aires had one hundred and eighty thousand people,
and in 1902 it contained eight hundred and fifty
thousand. Immigration had begun to pour in at
the rate of twenty thousand per annum, and had
rapidly increased to over a hundred thousand, when
the great crisis of 1890 temporarily interrupted the
flow. The years from 1868 to 1872 were prosperous
over much of the civilised world, but nowhere more
so than in Argentina. Sarmiento's administration
was, however, characterised by the beginning of
that policy of governmental and commercial extravagance
which has so deeply mortgaged the future
of Argentina, and has repeatedly hampered the
legitimate development of this marvellously fertile
region. In the ten years prior to 1872 foreign
commerce doubled, but the foreign debt increased
fivefold.</p>

<p>The last of the caudillos, Lopez Jordan of Entre
Rios, revolted in 1870 against Urquiza, who was
still governor of that province. The redoubtable
old patriot was captured by the rebels and assassinated.
In 1901 a monument was erected to his
memory in the city of Paran&aacute;, his old capital, and
the day of the unveiling was a national festival in
all the republic. The Federal government avenged
his death and suppressed the insurrection after an
obstinate, expensive, and bloody little war. Sarmiento's
administration was, however, not popular,
and the news that he had virtually determined to
name his successor created much dissatisfaction.
Mitre headed the opposition in the city, while in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the provinces some of the discontented went so far
as to take up arms. Julio Roca, then a young
colonel, defeated them at Santa Rosa, and Sarmiento
was able to hand over
the reins of government to
Dr. Avellaneda without
any further serious opposition.</p>

<span class="caption">JULIO ROCA.</span>
</div>

<p>A commercial crisis was
beginning when the new
President took office in
1874. He initiated a
policy of retrenchment,
under which the government
managed to pay its
obligations and weather
the storm. General Roca
was made Minister of War and came into further
prominence as the conqueror of the Indians, who
had hitherto prevented white men from settling
on the vast and valuable southern pampas. In
1854, after the fall of Rosas, the Indians recovered
most of the territory from which he had driven
them twenty years before. Later, the frontier was
advanced very slowly, but in 1877 Alsina, one of the
most successful governors Buenos Aires ever had,
undertook a vigorous campaign. In the following
year General Roca threw the power of the Federal
government into this vastly important enterprise.
He carried the frontier south to the Rio Negro and
west to the Andes, attacking the Indians in their
fortresses&mdash;a policy which insured permanent white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
domination. The ultimate consequences of opening
up to civilised settlement the immense territories
comprised in Roca's conquests cannot yet properly
be estimated. The vast region of Patagonia, that was
marked on the maps in our boyhood as an unclaimed
and uninhabitable arctic waste, has since been
added to Argentina as an indirect result of Roca's
campaign of 1878. Buenos Aires put in a claim for
the whole of the territory conquered from the Indians,
but the Federal statesmen refused to allow
one province to become well-nigh as large as all the
rest together. By a compromise her area was increased
to sixty-three thousand square miles, while
most of the new acquisition was divided into territories
under the direct administration of the Federal
government.</p>

<p>As the time for the presidential election of 1880
approached, political matters began to look ugly.
It was evident that Avellaneda intended to choose
his successor. Through the provincial governors,
the police, the army, the employees on the public
works, and the officials of all kinds he had easy
control of the election machinery. Even the most
scrupulous President often cannot prevent the exercise
of coercion in his name and without his knowledge.
The opposition in South America usually
refrain from voting: indeed, it is considered almost
indelicate for outsiders to interfere in a matter so
strictly official as an election. The privilege of voting
is not so highly prized and so jealously guarded
as in the United States and the northern countries
of Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Avellaneda and his adherents had fixed upon General
Roca as the next President. The principal
opposing candidate was Dr. Tejedor, governor of
Buenos Aires, who was supported by Mitre's party
and also by many of the other Buenos Aires party,
the "autonomists." The contest was really between
Buenos Aires and the provinces. General Roca was
strong with the army and with the country, but so
tremendously had Buenos Aires grown that the result
appeared doubtful. Her population, city and
province, had in 1880 reached six hundred and fifty
thousand,&mdash;more than a quarter of the total in the
whole Confederation. The next three provinces
put together did not equal her numbers and lagged
still farther behind in wealth and ability to concentrate
their forces.</p>

<p>Radical counsels prevailed in Buenos Aires. Roca's
opponents, seeing that they were at a hopeless
disadvantage with the election machinery in Avellaneda's
hands, determined to use violence. In
June, 1880, the partisans of Tejedor rose against the
Federal government. The police and militia of
the city joined them and paraded the streets, while
the alarm flew to the country, and the troops of the
line began to concentrate outside the city. Presently
the President and his Cabinet fled for safety to the
Federal camp. For a few weeks there was some
skirmishing and much negotiating, and in one encounter
near the south end of the city a thousand
Buenos Aireans were killed. Finally, the two sides
came to an agreement by which the Roca party retained
substantially all that they had been contend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ing
for. The General succeeded to the Presidency
without further opposition, and the city of Buenos
Aires was detached from the province. The federalisation
of the great city was the last step in the process
of adaptation that had been going on ever since
the expulsion of the Spaniards. Political equilibrium
between the provinces and Buenos Aires had been
reached. Thenceforth the latter's direct predominance
was to be purely intellectual, commercial, and
social. For the privilege of being capital of the
republic, the city exchanged her provincial autonomy.
Buenos Aires province, as formerly constituted,
was the greatest menace to a peaceful federal
union. In an assembly where the rights and influence
of all the provinces were supposed to be equal,
the magnitude of Buenos Aires was a constant occasion
for the jealousy of her smaller sisters and for
aggressions on her own part. Deprived of the city,
the remainder of the province was not powerful
enough to be dangerous. Now that it is federalised,
the city itself proves to be the strongest tie binding
together the different parts of the Confederation.</p>

<p>The greatest of all the waves of material prosperity
reached its culmination during Roca's first administration.
Business fairly boomed; foreign commerce
increased seventy-five per cent. from 1875 to 1885;
the exports of hides, cattle, wool, and wheat swelled
from year to year; the railroad mileage tripled in
ten years; the revenues mounted sixty per cent. in
five years; the use of the post-office, that excellent
measure of education, wealth, and higher national
energies, tripled. All danger of disturbances serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
enough to affect property rights had long since
passed; the provincial governors worked harmoniously
with the Federal authorities. A part of Roca's
system was to rest his power as chief executive on
the co-operation of the governors; the members of
Congress also bore somewhat the same relation to
the President. As a rule, a majority in Congress
supported his measures.</p>

<p>In spite of present prosperity, dangers had been
inherited from past administrations. There were
weak spots in the political and financial structure
that had grown too rapidly to be altogether well
built. The people still lacked the hard and continued
training in business that older nations have
had, and the national temperament tended toward
a reckless optimism. European money lenders
stood ready to stimulate this tendency by offering
easy credit facilities in return for careless promises
of exaggerated interest rates. The medium of exchange
was a vastly inflated and fluctuating paper
currency. From the beginning Argentine rulers
had resorted to note issues to tide over their pecuniary
difficulties. When Rosas assumed power
in 1829 the paper dollar was worth fifteen cents, and
by 1846 he had driven it down to four cents. In
1866, Mitre's administration had established a new
arbitrary par at twenty-five paper dollars for one
gold dollar. Sarmiento's extravagances made suspension
necessary and sent gold to a premium. In
1883 President Roca remodelled the currency, issuing
new notes convertible into gold, and exchanging
them for the old paper at the rate of twenty-five for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
one. But his effort to contract and steady the circulating
medium excited protests from a community
that was growing rich in the rapid inflation of values.
Foreign money was being loaned to all sorts of
Argentine enterprises on a scale that, considering the
small population of the country, has never been
precedented anywhere. Railroads, ranches, commercial
houses, banks, land schemes, building enterprises,
were capitalised for the asking. The provincial
governments borrowed money recklessly, while interest
was guaranteed on new railroads, and charters
granted to all sorts of speculative enterprises. The
nation undertook to supply itself in a single decade
with the drainage works, the docks, the public buildings,
the parks, the railroads, that older countries
have needed a generation to provide. So much
capital was being fixed that the attempt at specie
resumption cramped the speculative world. Within
two years it was given up, and issues of paper money
resumed.</p>

<p>General Roca retired from office in 1886, and was
succeeded by his brother-in-law, Juarez Celman.
The four years during which the latter remained in
office are memorable for reckless private and public
borrowing. The healthy activity of General Roca's
administration gave place to a mad fever of speculation.
Congress passed a national banking act, and
under its provisions banks of issue were established
in nearly every province. The paper circulation almost
quadrupled and the premium on gold doubled.
The Federal government followed the example set
by the provinces and municipalities, and burdened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>the country with an indebtedness which has mortgaged
the future of the country for years to come.
Between 1885 and 1891 the foreign debt was increased
nearly threefold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

[From a lithograph.]</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
</div>

<p>During 1887 and 1888 few apprehensions of the
inevitable result of the inflation seem to have been
entertained. Up to the very day of the crash of
1889 the government cheerfully continued to borrow,
to plan magnificent public improvements, and
to build expensive railways. The public speculated
confidently in the mortgage scrip issued through the
provincial mortgage banks. Early in 1889 the government
began to have difficulty in meeting some of
the enormous obligations which it had undertaken.
Conservative people became apprehensive; the independent
press raised a warning voice. A ministerial
crisis was followed by a panic in the Exchange.
The new Secretary of the Treasury, in an effort to
prevent further depreciation of the currency, diverted
the redemption fund held by the government
for bank issues. The currency dropped with sickening
rapidity; the bubble companies collapsed; the
public realised that many of the banks were unable
to meet their obligations.</p>

<p>At this crisis public alarm and indignation found
a vent in the formation of a revolutionary society,
called the Civic Union, which was pledged to overthrow
President Celman. On July 26, 1890, disturbances
began and there was a little fighting in the
streets. Police and troops, however, put no spirit
into their efforts to suppress the rioters. The President's
best friends urged him to resign, and Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
passed a formal memorial to that effect. There was
nothing for him to do but to obey the manifest wish
of the people; he handed in his resignation and the
Vice-President, Dr. Carlos Pellegrini, peacefully succeeded
him.</p>

<p>The situation went from bad to worse; in 1891
the currency dropped to twenty-three cents on the
dollar, the banks failed, and the laws for collection
of debts were suspended for two months. The
most which Dr. Pellegrini could hope to do was to
hold things together until the general election should
be held fifteen months later. No human wisdom
could devise measures that would give immediate
prosperity, and the public would be satisfied with
nothing less. Dr. Pellegrini had to wait until later
years for a proper appreciation of his labours. The
other two great national figures were General Roca
and General Mitre. The first had the prestige of his
strong and successful administration; he enjoyed the
confidence of the army, and he was the head of the
great Nationalist party which was especially powerful
in the provinces. General Mitre, the most eminent
citizen of Buenos Aires, and in a way the living
embodiment of the previous forty years of national
history, had inevitably been selected as chief of the
Civic Union. He had therefore led the movement
through which the public opinion of the capital had
overthrown Celman.</p>

<p>Mitre and Roca had co-operated in securing a
peaceful transfer of the government from Celman to
Pellegrini. Roca was inclined to favour Mitre for
the presidency, but it soon became evident that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
latter could not control the more radical members
of the Civic Union, and that his candidacy would
not reconcile all parties. February 19, 1891, an
attempt to assassinate Roca was perpetrated in the
streets of Buenos Aires. The spirit of mutiny grew
alarmingly, and a state of siege was proclaimed; the
Civic Union split into warring camps; trouble broke
out in Cordoba, and successful revolutions overthrew
the legal state governments in Catamarca and
Santiago del Estero. Mitre and Roca formally withdrew
from active political life in the hope that this
might placate the dissident politicians.</p>

<p>The candidate fixed upon by the wing of Nationals
who adhered to Roca, and the moderates of the Civic
Union led by Mitre, was Doctor Luiz Saenz Pe&ntilde;a,
ex-Justice of the Supreme Court. The Pellegrini
government gave him its earnest support, and charges
were made by the Radicals that their votes would
be forcibly suppressed in the election of October,
1891. They determined to anticipate violence with
violence, but, on the eve of the election in October,
1891, their leaders were imprisoned and a state of
siege declared. Saenz Pe&ntilde;a was elected, but the
Radicals began to intrigue to obtain control of the
provincial governments, which would enable them
to force his resignation or his compliance with their
wishes. Serious trouble broke out early in 1892 in
the province of Corrientes, with which the Buenos
Aires radicals openly sympathised. The new President
quickly cut loose from the Roca wing of the
Nationalist party and allied himself closely with the
moderate Civic Unionists, now usually called "Mit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>ristas."
The President's own son, who had been a
candidate against him, headed the faction of the
Nationalist party that had renounced Roca's leadership.
Revolutionary movements against the governors
who belonged to the Roca faction began in
several provinces. In February there were armed
protests in Santa F&eacute; against a new wheat tax; a revolt
broke out in Catamarca in April; by July the
Saenz Pe&ntilde;a administration was in the gravest difficulties.
San Luiz and Santa F&eacute; rebelled, and in
August Salta and Tucuman followed. It was manifest
that the President was not strong enough to
hold down the selfish factions who saw in the general
dissatisfaction and financial distress only an opportunity
to get into office by force of arms.</p>

<p>Congress remained neutral until it became evident
that no accommodation could be reached between
the President and his opponents, and that the latter
would press on to overthrowing the government
and probably precipitate a serious civil war. In this
crisis, however, the majority agreed to laws which
authorised armed Federal intervention in the troubles
in San Luiz and Santa F&eacute;. But in September the
national troops themselves showed symptoms of
mutiny and by this time most of the provinces
were convulsed by revolutionary movements which
the central government was manifestly not strong
enough to suppress or control.</p>

<p>On September 25th, General Roca took command
of the army; the most dangerous radical leaders in
Buenos Aires were thrown into prison; and on October
1st he captured Rosario, the second city of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Republic, and the chief place in Santa F&eacute;, which
for months had been in the hands of revolutionists.
This was a beginning of the end of the troubles
that menaced public order. Six million dollars had
been expended by the government in fruitless
marchings to and fro of troops, but no serious harm
had been done. The scene of the contest between
the ambitious factions was transferred to Congress,
the Cabinet, and the Press. Throughout 1893 and
1894 the President struggled with his factional and
financial difficulties, and gradually lost control of
Congress and prestige in the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, commercial liquidation was proceeding
normally and, as always, painfully. The great
Provincial Mortgage Bank, through the agency of
which a vast amount of the land scrip had been issued
in the Celman days, was granted a moratorium
for five years. Other actual bankruptcies were
legally admitted and enforced. The mortgage scrip
payable in gold was replaced by currency obligations.
The government had proved unequal to the
task of balancing its own receipts and expenses.
Taxes were increased until rebellion seemed imminent,
but expenditures still outran them. The deficits
mounted in spite of the efforts toward economy
and the returning prosperity of the business world.
The boundary dispute with Chile had assumed a
threatening aspect; war seemed imminent, and the
military and naval estimates were largely increased.
In January, 1895, President Saenz Pe&ntilde;a called an
extra session of Congress to vote supplies for the
expected war with Chile and to consider the financial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
proposals of the government. Congress demanded
that political grievances should be redressed. The
President had been persecuting the army officers
who had been implicated in the revolutionary disturbances,
and a vast majority of Congress insisted
that a complete amnesty be granted to all political
offenders. When the President refused, the Cabinet
resigned in a body and Congress and the opposition
brought every pressure to bear. It was soon evident
that Congress must win, and on January 22,
1895, the President resigned.</p>

<p>The Vice-President, Doctor Uriburu, succeeded
for the unexpired period of three years, during
which little progress was made toward a settlement
of the nation's financial difficulties. Symptoms of
renewed extravagance appeared. In 1897, the issuance
of $10,000,000 of mortgage scrip was authorised,
and the city of Buenos Aires received permission
to borrow $5,000,000. Work on the great docks
of Buenos Aires, costing $35,000,000, was pushed
to completion, and in February the paper dollars
dropped back to 33 cents, while the deficit for the
year was over $20,000,000.</p>

<p>In July, 1897, General Roca was nominated for
the Presidency by the Convention of the National
party, with Dr. Pellegrini in the chair. There was
no real opposition to his election. Again and again
during a quarter of a century he had proved himself
able to cope with the most difficult situations which
had arisen in Argentine affairs. In 1890, his firmness
and adroitness had saved the country from the
agony of a useless political upheaval after the failure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the Celman administration. During the anxious
months that followed the panic, his generosity had
secured a co-operation of the moderates of Buenos
Aires with his own immediate followers in holding
back the Radicals and revolutionists in check. During
the critical year of 1892, the outbreaks against
the Saenz Pe&ntilde;a administration increased in violence
until it seemed as if the country would be convulsed
with a serious civil war, but when Roca stepped in
the tide of disorganisation turned, and his firm hand
re-established the authority of the Federal government.
His prestige and his personality enabled him
to count upon an obedience from the chiefs of the
provincial factions which was of inestimable value.
He possessed those rare and indispensable qualities
which make a man a centre around which other men
can rally. He had built up the one really national
party in the country and was faithful to his friends
and his adherents, but sufficiently broad-minded to
combine with other parties when the interests of the
whole country demanded it.</p>

<p>General Roca entered upon his second presidential
term in the beginning of 1898. One of his first acts
was to intervene in Buenos Aires province and put
an end to a deadlock between the governor and the
Provincial Assembly. The boundary dispute with
Chile, a question which, in spite of the earnest desire
of both governments for peace, might at any
time precipitate a ruinous war, was submitted for
settlement by arbitration. W. J. Buchanan, the
United States Minister at Buenos Aires, named as
arbitrator for the northern frontier, quickly an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>nounced
a decision which was promptly accepted by
both parties. The more complicated southern frontier
could not so easily be prepared for submission;
a serious misunderstanding arose, and both countries
felt compelled to spend large sums for armaments
which they knew they could ill afford.
Happily, a decision was at last rendered in 1902.
No question now remains open which is likely to
involve the external peace of Argentina.</p>

<p>Internal peace has not been menaced during General
Roca's term. The commercial situation of the
country has vastly improved. Immigration, which
had largely ceased after 1890, has again risen to
over a hundred thousand a year. Wheat exports
rose from 4,000,000 bushels in 1897 to 61,000,000
in 1900. The total exports in 1899 were $185,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>000,000,
twice as great per capita as the record
export of the United States. There have been no
issues of paper money, and the value of the currency
has risen to forty cents. The government has
established a new artificial par at a little more than
this sum, and has begun accumulating a gold reserve.
A resumption of specie payments is soon expected.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the chief difficulties and preoccupations
of the Roca administration have been with
financial questions. A deficit of $70,000,000 had
accumulated in the few years before 1898, and the interest
on the immense public debt makes an equilibrium in
the budget almost impossible. Many of the
provincial governments have defaulted, and the
national government has had to carry their burdens
in addition to its own, to satisfy clamorous foreign
creditors. In 1901 it was proposed to unify the debt,
refunding the whole at a lower rate of interest, and
specifically pledging certain sources of public income.
This plan had the approval of the government, but
the national pride was touched by the latter feature.
The populace could not bear the idea of giving a
sort of mortgage on the country. The passage of
the bill by Congress was met with so many demonstrations
of popular disapproval that it was abandoned.
This change of front was accompanied by
the formation of an alliance between the followers
of General Mitre and those of General Roca.</p>

<p>The industrial impetus already acquired by the
Argentine Republic is sufficient to carry it over all
obstacles, and it seems assured that there will be a
rapid settlement of the whole of this immense and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
fertile plain. Here nature has done everything to
make communication easy, and a temperate climate
insures crops suited to modern European civilisation.
Two grave perils have so far been encountered&mdash;namely,
a tendency toward political disintegration
and an abuse of the taxing power. The former is
now remote, for since the railways began to concentrate
wealth and influence at Buenos Aires, and to
destroy the prestige and political power of the provincial
capitals, the national structure built by the
patriots of 1853 has stood firmer each year.</p>

<p>The Argentine has had a bitter lesson of the evils
of governmental extravagance, and still groans under
the burden of a debt which seems disproportionately
heavy, but the growth of population and wealth will
soon overtake it, and the very difficulties of meeting
interest are the cause of an economy in administration,
of which the good effects will be felt long after
the debt itself has been reduced to a reasonable per
capita. A nation is in the process of formation
in the Plate valley whose material greatness is certain,
and whose moral and intellectual characteristics
will have the widest influence on the rest of South
America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>PARAGUAY UNTIL 1632</h3>


<p>The beginnings of the settlements in Paraguay
have been sketched in the introductory chapter
on the discoveries and conquest. In 1526,
Cabot, searching to find a route to the gold and
silver mines of the centre of the continent, penetrated
as far as the site of the present city of Asuncion.
He had already, in the exploration of the
Upper Paran&aacute;, skirted the southern and eastern
boundary of what has since become the country of
Paraguay. Ten years later the exhausted and discouraged
remnants of Mendoza's great expedition
sought rest and refuge among the peaceful agricultural
tribes of this region. Under Domingos Irala,
these six hundred surviving Spanish adventurers
founded Asuncion in 1536, the first settlement of
the valley of the Plate. They reduced the Indians
to a mild slavery, compelling them to build houses,
perform menial services, and cultivate the soil. The
country was divided into great tracts called "encomiendas,"
which, with the Indians that inhabited
them, were distributed among the settlers. Few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
women had been able to follow Mendoza's expedition,
so the Spaniards of Asuncion took wives from
among the Indians. Subsequent immigration was
small, and the proportion of Spanish blood has
always been inconsiderable, compared with the
number of aborigines. The children of the marriages
between the Spanish conquerors and Indian
women were proud of their white descent. The
superior strain of blood easily dominated, and the
mixed Paraguayan Creoles became Spaniards to all
intents and purposes. Spaniards and Creoles, however,
learned the Indian language; Guarany rather
than Spanish became, and has remained, the most
usual method of communication.</p>

<p>The Spaniards of Asuncion were turbulent and
disinclined to submit to authority. They paid scant
respect to the adelantados, whom the Castilian king
sent out one after another as feudal proprietors.
Until his death Irala was the most influential man
in the colony, but his power rested on his own
energy and capacity, and on the fear and respect in
which he was held by his companions, more than on
the royal commission that finally could not be withheld
from him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<img src="images/illus-187.jpg" width="1024" height="668" alt="ASUNCION." title="" />
<span class="caption">ASUNCION.</span>
</div>

<p>Across the river from Asuncion stretched away to
the west the vast and swampy plains of the great
Chaco. It was inhabited by wandering tribes of
Indians whom the Spaniards could not subdue.
They fled before the expeditions like scared wild
beasts, only to turn and mercilessly massacre every
man when a chance was offered for ambush or surprise.
To the east of the Paraguay River the coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>try
was dry, rolling, and extremely fertile. Though
covered with magnificent forests it was easily penetrable
all the way across to the Paran&aacute;. Its inhabitants
were the docile Guaranies, who knew something
of agriculture and in whose villages considerable
stores of food were to be found. The population
was dense for savages, but they had no political or
military organisation. Divided into small tribes
which did not co-operate, they rendered little respect
or obedience to their chiefs. Under these
conditions Spanish authority rapidly spread over
central and southern Paraguay. Before Irala died,
in 1557, the settlers had reached the Paran&aacute; on the
western boundary and founded settlements nearly
as far north as the Grand Cataract.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the Creoles of Asuncion began
their expeditions to the South. By 1580 they
controlled the Paran&aacute; River from its confluence with
the Paraguay to the ocean, had established Santa
F&eacute; and Buenos Aires on its right bank, and opened
up the southern pampa. The pastoral provinces on
the Lower Paran&aacute; were slowly peopled. A large
proportion of the energetic Paraguayan Creoles preferred
the semi-nomadic life of the plains to indolence
among their Indian slaves in the tropical forests
of Paraguay. The two regions were distinct in climate,
habits of life, social and industrial organisation.
They became separated in interests and soon
were to be divided politically. Though, until 1619,
the whole province continued to bear the name of
Paraguay, the usual residence of the governor was
Buenos Aires. Asuncion was often forced to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
content with a lieutenant-governor, and was fast
relegated to the position of a neglected and isolated
district.</p>

<p>In the days of the Spanish conquest, Franciscan
monks were the priests who most often accompanied
the expeditions, and they took the most prominent
part in the earliest establishment of religion. The
members of this Order, however, with a few notable
exceptions, took no special interest in the evangelisation
of the aborigines. On the contrary, they
were as fierce as the soldiers themselves in their
cruelties to the poor Indians. The shouts of a
Franciscan monk set on Pizarro's ruffians to the
slaughter of the Incas that surrounded Atahualpa.
Those that came to Paraguay preferred to live in
the towns, and their conduct toward the Indians
differed little from that of the lay Spaniards. It
was the genius of Ignatius Loyola that conceived
and perfected a machine able to carry Christianity
and civilisation to these remote and inaccessible
peoples and regions. Within a few years after its
foundation, the Society of Jesus turned its attention
to the evangelisation of South America; in 1550 the
Jesuit Fathers began their work in Brazil. Their successes
and failures in that country had little relation
with their work in Spanish South America. It is curious,
however, that their most successful early work
in Brazil should have been done in S&atilde;o Paulo, on the
extreme eastern border of the wide plateau which
drains to the west into the Paran&aacute;. For a decade
or two after 1550, they laboured hard to gather the
Indians of that region into villages, to teach them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Christianity, and protect them against the tyrannies
and exactions of the Portuguese settlers. The contest
was unequal; the Jesuits were not long able to
prevent the enslavement of their proselytes. The
Paulistas destroyed the Jesuit missions in their
neighbourhood and became the most expert in Indian
warfare and the most terrible foes of the Jesuit
system of all the colonists of South America. Their
determined opposition was the most potent cause
in preventing the subjection of South America to a
theocratic system of government.</p>

<p>About 1586 the Jesuit Fathers entered Paraguay
for the purpose of beginning the evangelisation of
the Indians of the Plate valley. They established
a school in Asuncion and pushed out on foot into
the remoter districts. Their success was phenomenal.
They spared no pains to learn the language of the
savages so that they might teach them in their own
tongue. They approached them with kindness and
benevolence showing in every gesture. They availed
themselves of the Indians' love of bright colours and
showy processions. They went unarmed and alone,
offering useful and attractive presents, conforming
to savage customs and prejudices, and imposing on
the vivid savage imagination with the pomp of
Catholic worship. They taught their savage pupils
how to cultivate the ground to get greater results,
how to save themselves unnecessary labour, and how
to live comfortably. They persuaded them to
gather into towns, where they built comfortable
houses and tight warehouses, while the men cultivated
the soil and the women spun and wove cotton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jesuits came almost immediately into conflict
with the interests of the Spanish colonists.
They were welcomed at first, because they were expected
to lend themselves to the enslavement of the
Indians. When their real purposes were discovered
feeling against them rose high. The Creoles clearly
saw that it was going to be far more difficult to extend
their power over the Indians gathered together
in villages under Jesuit protection than over
unorganised and friendless bands of unconverted
savages.</p>

<p>Before 1610 the number of Jesuits that had come
to Paraguay was very small. Among the first was
the Father named Thomas Fields, a Scotchman.
As a matter of fact, the Jesuits were recruited from
all the nations of Europe and under their military
system had to go wherever they might be sent.
English, Irish, and German names, as well as Spanish,
are to be found in the lists of Jesuits who
laboured in Paraguay.</p>

<p>In 1608 Philip III. of Spain attended to the complaints
that came to him through the powerful chiefs
of the Order of the indifference and opposition
shown by the settlers and colonial authorities, and
gave his royal and official sanction to the Jesuit
conversion of the Indians along the Upper Paran&aacute;.
By this time the Fathers had penetrated across to
the Paran&aacute; and had followed up that stream far
north of the Grand Cataract in latitude 24&deg;, which
marks the northern boundary of Paraguay proper.
It is hard to understand how they overcame the
difficulties of travelling. To this day it is well-nigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
impossible to reach the Grand Cataract, and years
pass without that wonder of nature's being seen by
the eyes of civilised man. No part of the world,
outside the Arctic regions, is less accessible than the
Paran&aacute; above the Grand Cataract. Yet these heroic
priests made that region the principal theatre of
their operations in the early years of the seventeenth
century. The territory is now all Brazilian,&mdash;the
boundaries of that republic extend on the east bank
of the Paran&aacute; south nearly to the twenty-sixth degree
and on the west bank to the twenty-fourth.
The rivers Paranapanema and Ivahy are great
tributaries coming down from the east between the
twenty-second and twenty-third degrees, and draining
a vast extent of the plateau that extends to the
Brazilian coast mountains between Curitiba and S&atilde;o
Paulo, and on their banks the Jesuits established
their principal missions.</p>

<p>In those days there were no clearly defined boundaries
between the Portuguese and Spanish dominions.
From 1580 to 1640 the king of Spain was
also monarch of Portugal. The Jesuits held his
royal letters patent for the conversion of the Indians
of the province of Guayr&aacute;&mdash;the name which this remote
region bore. They had no reason to anticipate
that they would be accused of being invaders of
Portuguese territory, or that they would be interfered
with by any Portuguese subjects of the Spanish
Crown. The nearest Portuguese settlement was at
S&atilde;o Paulo, from which Guayr&aacute; could be reached
only by the long and tedious descent of the Tiet&eacute;
River to its confluence with the Paran&aacute;, and thence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
down that river to the Ivahy. Months would be
necessary to make such a journey, great difficulties
encountered with waterfalls and rapids, and great
privations from want of food in the vast uninhabited
regions on the route.</p>

<p>The first Jesuits to arrive after the granting of
formal authorisation by the Spanish king were two
Italians. They left Asuncion October 10, 1609, and
it took them five months of incessant travelling to
reach the Paranapanema. The work already done
there by the earlier Fathers had borne some fruit.
The Indians were prepared for the coming of the new
missionaries and readily gathered into the towns
which they founded in rapid succession. For the
first few years all went well, and within a very short
time they claimed to have at least forty thousand
souls under their guidance. In 1614 there were 119
Jesuits in Paraguay and Guayr&aacute;, and the work
of evangelising and reducing to obedience the
whole Guarany population of the Paran&aacute; valley
went on apace. For twenty years these Guayr&aacute;
missions spread and prospered, while to the east and
south the Jesuits acquired more and more influence
with the Indians in Paraguay proper, and more and
more hemmed in the Creoles of Asuncion.</p>

<p>In 1629 a thunderbolt burst upon Guayr&aacute; out of
a clear sky. The Portuguese from S&atilde;o Paulo appeared
before the Mission of San Antonio and destroyed
it utterly, burning the church and houses
and driving off the Indians as slaves. Other missions
shortly suffered the same fate, and within the
short space of three years the towns had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
sacked, most of the inhabitants of the region carried
off or killed, and the remnants had fled down the
river under the leadership of the Fathers. The
Paulistas were animated by motives, some good,
some bad. Primarily they wished to capture slaves.
They hated the Jesuits and had themselves suffered
from the latter's system of segregating the aborigines.
Only a few decades before, their fathers
had destroyed the Jesuit missions near S&atilde;o Paulo,
and they were determined not to permit themselves
to be hemmed in and crowded out by Indians ruled
and protected by Jesuits. They believed in the doctrine
of "Brazil for the White Brazilians," and they
regarded the Jesuits and their neophytes as natural
enemies and fair prey. The sentiment of nationality
also animated them. As descendants of Portuguese
they hated the Spaniards and their rule. Their allegiance
to the Spanish dynasty that had usurped
the crown of Portugal sat lightly. The Jesuits came
by way of Asuncion, their communications were
with the Spanish authorities, and most of them were
Spaniards. The Paulistas, as Portuguese, viewed
with alarm a rapid spread of Spanish ecclesiastics
up the Paran&aacute; valley, which threatened soon to
reach their own neighbourhood. Avarice, love of
adventure, race pride, patriotism, hatred of priestly
domination, all co-operated to push them on to undertaking
these memorable expeditions.</p>

<p>The great extension of the Jesuits over the northern
and eastern regions of the Paran&aacute; valley occurred
during the period when Hernandarias was
the dominant figure of the Plate. Creole though he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
was, this remarkable man was a friend to the Indian
and to the missionary work of the Jesuits. His aid
and encouragement in 1609 were essential to the
latter's success, for he might easily have nullified the
effect of the royal permission to evangelise Guayr&aacute;,
a formal document that would have been of little
value against the delays and excuses of an unwilling
governor aided by the jealous people. After his
first term as governor at Buenos Aires, the Spanish
government determined to put a stop to the more
flagrant of the abuses practised against the savages
and created the office of "Protector of the Indians."
Hernandarias was named to fill it, and carried out his
instructions in a moderate spirit. He understood
the country and the situation of the colony well,
and did not undertake to abolish Indian slavery. In
that tropical climate the whites will not labour in
the fields so long as there are Indians who can be
forced to work, and the Spaniards still regarded the
Indian as little better than an animal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hernandarias was too intelligent
not to see that there must be restraints on the
cruelties and exactions of the Creoles if the Indians
of Paraguay were to be saved from the extermination
that had been the fate of the Haytians a century
before. The outcome was, that though a new
code of laws was promulgated by the impracticable
Spanish king, which forbade any further enslavement
of the aborigines, its provisions were largely disregarded.
At the same time, however, the Indians
acquired a legal status, and their condition was gradually
improved until it became not much worse than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that of the contemporaneous European peasantry.
The Jesuits were guaranteed against interference
and allowed to go out into the remoter wilderness
and give to the yet unslaved inhabitants the invaluable
protection of membership in their missions.</p>

<p>In 1619 the natural and commercial division between
Paraguay proper and the rest of the province
was officially recognised. The region between the
Paraguay and the Paran&aacute; rivers was made a separate
province, directly dependent upon the Viceroy at
Lima and the Audiencia at Charcas in Bolivia. It
included officially the Jesuit missions south-east of
the Paran&aacute; as well as the present territory of Paraguay.</p>

<p>When the Paulistas began their terrible attacks on
the Guayr&aacute; missions in 1629, the governor of Paraguay
refused to send any assistance to the Jesuits.
The latter charged him with a corrupt understanding
with the invaders, by which he was to share in the
profits of the slaves sold. The Order had agreed
with the Spanish government not to put any arms
into the hands of the Indians, so the latter were defenceless
against the Paulistas, who attacked musket
in hand. The Creoles and Spaniards in Asuncion
resented more and more the presence and power of
the Jesuits, and viewed with ill-concealed satisfaction
the misfortunes that now overwhelmed the priests.
The governor, in declining to send help, was only
carrying out the wishes of the people around him.
Had the number of whites in Paraguay not been so
very small the Jesuits might have been expelled as
they were in S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE JESUIT REPUBLIC AND COLONIAL PARAGUAY</h3>


<p>We have no accounts of the Jesuit missions in
Guayr&aacute;, or of the tragedy of their destruction,
except those that were written by the Fathers
themselves. These are filled with manifest exaggerations
and marred by omissions which we have
few means of correcting. Nevertheless, the bold
outlines of a story that for bravery, pathos, and devotion
rivals any ever told are clear and indisputable.
Within such a short period as twenty years the
Jesuits had not succeeded in training the Guayr&aacute;
Indians to any very high degree of civilisation.
They complain that the Indians were still prone to
return to the worship of their devils. Nevertheless,
the massive walls of churches which have survived
the devastation wrought by three centuries of tropical
rains bear witness that the Jesuits had gathered
together a multitude of people and had taught them
a measure of skilled labour.</p>

<p>Of the completeness of the victory of the Paulistas
there is no doubt. Within three years, tens of
thousands of Indians were carried off to S&atilde;o Paulo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and hardly a town was left standing in the province
of Guayr&aacute;. Father Montoya, chief Jesuit, has left
an account of the Hegira which he led down the
river. Though he is silent as to the part he took
himself, it is hard to read his pages and not give him
a place among the world's great heroes. Twelve
thousand Indians of every sex and age assembled
on the Paranapanema with the few belongings
which they had been able to bring from the homes
that they were forced to abandon. The Paulistas
were daily expected to return, and the only hope of
escape was to float down the river and get beyond
the Grand Cataract of the Paran&aacute;. The journey to
the beginning of the falls was made without any
great losses; there the difficulties began. Ninety
miles of falls and rapids intervene between navigable
water above and below the Grand Cataract. Across
the river valley extends a mountain chain with
slopes rugged and covered with dense vegetation.
The river divides into various channels, and the sides
of the gorges are clothed in cane-brakes and tangled
forests through which a path had to be cut with
machetes. These poor Jesuits and their thousands
of scared, patient Indians had no boats awaiting
them at the foot of the falls, so they had to continue
their dreary passage through the gorges and
cane-brakes, where wild Indians lay in ambush with
poisoned arrows, until at last a place was reached
where canoes could be built. Still they struggled
on, the indomitable Jesuits taking every precaution.
Though out of immediate danger from the Paulistas
when they had passed the cataract, the Spaniards on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>the right bank below were hardly less to be feared.
They were waiting on the shore of the Paran&aacute; for
news of the fugitives in order to pounce on them and
make a rich haul of slaves. The provisions were
exhausted, but the Jesuits dared not apply for help
to the Creoles. Fever broke out and, sick and starving,
the devoted Jesuits and their uncomplaining
followers worked away on their boats and rafts.
At last they got them ready, and, slipping past the
Spanish settlements in the night, they finally reached
some small Jesuit missions near the mouth of the
Iguass&uacute;, five hundred miles from their starting-point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<img src="images/illus-199.jpg" width="1024" height="667" alt="FALLS." title="" />
<span class="caption">GUAYR&Aacute; FALLS.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
</div>

<p>The Jesuits resolved to evacuate Guayr&aacute; completely
and to build up their power anew in the
country between the Paran&aacute; and the Uruguay.
Within the next few years they had occupied the
country that is now the Argentine Territory of the
missions. This tract lay directly across the Paran&aacute;,
from that part of Paraguay proper in which the
Jesuits were most powerful, to the other side of
the Uruguay, where was a fertile territory which
proved an excellent field for the extension of the
settlement. Before many years these missions
stretched in a broad band from the centre of Paraguay
three hundred miles to the south-east; they
dominated southern Paraguay and half the present
Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul with the
country that lies between, while their towns lined
both banks of the Upper Uruguay and the Middle
Paran&aacute;, cutting off the Creoles from extending their
settlements up either of these great rivers.</p>

<p>Now that the priests had concentrated their forces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
so near, the alarm of the Creoles became acute.
The Jesuits managed to obtain the dismissal of the
governor who had refused to send them aid when
they were attacked by the Paulistas and were driven
from Guayr&aacute;, but his successor also became a partisan
of the Creoles as soon as he reached Asuncion.
He visited the missions near the river Paran&aacute; and
ordered that they be secularised on the ground that
these regions had already been subjected by Spanish
arms before its occupation by the priests. But the
Jesuits were good lawyers and had powerful friends
at every Court, so the governor was forced to reverse
his action.</p>

<p>The next governor helped to make the Jesuits
secure from Paulista interference below the Grand
Cataract, by defeating an important expedition
which had reached the new missions. The Paulistas
did not confine their aggressions to the missions,
but alarmed the Spanish Creoles themselves by penetrating
west of the Paran&aacute; into Paraguay proper.
Even Asuncion did not feel safe for a time. The
Jesuits had now begun to arm and drill the Indians.
Though the Paulistas made expeditions from time
to time, and the Spanish and Jesuit frontier settlements
were frequently aroused by the news of a
bloody raid and of the rapid depredations of a band
of these dreaded marauders, there was never again
such wholesale destruction as had taken place in
Guayr&aacute;. The frontiers of the Spanish and Portuguese
peoples on the Paran&aacute; remain to this day
substantially as they were fixed by the Paulista
expeditions of 1630 to 1640.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>In their conflict with the Jesuits, the Creoles
shortly received a valuable reinforcement in Bishop
Cardenas, a very able and energetic prelate, and a
man gifted as a ruler and statesman. Born in the
city of Charcas, on the Bolivian plateau, he was a
Creole of the Creoles. He became a great missionary
and evangelist throughout Upper Peru and
Tucuman, acquiring wonderful fame and popularity
by his eloquence. In spite of the fact that he was
a Creole, he was immensely popular among the Indians,
and seems to have been a natural leader of
both branches of the native population. He bitterly
hated the Jesuits. As a member of the rival Franciscan
Order, his professional jealousy was aroused
by their success, and his Creole prejudices were
outraged by their efforts to prevent the extension
of white power among the aborigines.</p>

<p>By sheer force of ability and eloquence, he rose
into great prominence in southern Spanish America,
and was rewarded for his successful labours in Tucuman
by being appointed Bishop of Paraguay.
There the Creoles accepted him as their leader, and
he soon became the dominant figure in the community.
He quarrelled repeatedly with the governor,
but such was his force of character, and the
skill with which he took advantage of the superstitious
reverence for his apostolic office, that he
invariably achieved his ends. Once the governor,
at the head of a file of soldiers, presented himself at
the bishop's door to arrest a fugitive whom the
bishop had undertaken to protect. When the door
was opened there stood the dauntless priest in full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
canonicals, defying the governor to cross his threshold.
He excommunicated the governor and every
soldier who had dared take part in this affront to
his dignity, and, like Hildebrand, was only appeased
when the governor had begged for pardon on his
knees.</p>

<p>When the governor died, Bishop Cardenas succeeded
<i>ad interim</i>. His popularity and prestige
were unbounded, and his audacity and courage unprecedented.
Uniting in himself the religious, civil,
and popular power, he controlled the forces of the
community more completely than any one who had
preceded him. His great work was the humiliation
and destruction of the Jesuits. He hampered their
insidious spread on the hither side of the Paran&aacute;,
and attempted the secularisation of many of their
missions. In 1649 he took the audacious step of
issuing a decree expelling all the members of the
Society of Jesus, and he actually drove the Fathers
from their churches and schools in Asuncion itself.
The Jesuits appealed to the Viceroy, and a governor
was sent out to depose him.</p>

<p>Twenty years had now elapsed since the Jesuits
had armed the Mission Indians and organised them
into an efficient militia. An army was, therefore,
ready to the new governor's hand. The Creoles of
western Paraguay were riotous and tumultuous,
but in that tropical climate they had lost much of
the military capacity of their Spanish ancestors.
The number of people of Spanish descent was small
and while the secular Indians made admirable soldiers
when disciplined and well led, they had never been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
organised by the Creoles for serious warfare. The
military system of the Jesuits immediately proved
its superiority. Aided by the prestige of his Viceregal
commission, the new governor at the head
of the Jesuit army quickly overcame the hastily
gathered levies of the Bishop.</p>

<p>For the next one hundred and twenty years the
Jesuits maintained their system in south-eastern
Paraguay and the regions on both banks of the
Paran&aacute; and the Upper Uruguay. Until 1728 their
territory was nominally under the jurisdiction of
the governor of Asuncion. Really, however, it was
an independent republic ruled by a superior whose
capital was at Candelaria, and who was actually
responsible to no one except his General at Rome
and the authorities at Madrid. In the secular part
of Paraguay, the formerly turbulent and secular
Creoles sank more and more into the indifference
characteristic of the Indians who surrounded them.
Early in the eighteenth century a governor named
Antequera, whom the Viceregal authorities attempted
to depose, was forcibly maintained for a
time by the Paraguayan Creoles&mdash;probably the
earliest instance of an important movement toward
independence which occurred in South America.
The Paraguayans only yielded when a compromise
was offered. The old ferocity which the original
conquerors had felt against the Indians gave place
gradually to kindlier sentiments. From slaves the
Indians rose into serfs and then into peasants, living
on good terms with the proprietors of their lands,
and not more oppressed by Spanish officials than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the whites themselves. Secular Paraguay, shut in
on the west by the impenetrable Chaco with its
hordes of dreaded wild Indians, and on the east by
the Jesuit territory, could not expand. Indeed the
impulse toward conquest and exploration which so
distinguished the Paraguayan Creoles in the latter
part of the sixteenth century, had completely died
out as early as the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1728, the Jesuit republic was formally detached
from the jurisdiction of Paraguay and placed under
that of the government of Buenos Aires. The missions
were all situated on or near the banks of the
Upper Paran&aacute; and Uruguay, and their line of communication
with the outside world ran directly to
Buenos Aires. They had few commercial relations
with Asuncion and it was inconvenient to maintain
even a shadow of political relation with that capital.
The Jesuit missions prospered, although, curiously
enough, their population remained stationary. South
and east of the Paran&aacute;, the country which they occupied
was mostly an open, rolling plain admirably
suited for pasturage. Herding cattle was the chief
employment of the Indians and the chief source of
the exports. However, in the forests north-west of
the Paran&aacute;, agriculture was more practised, and the
principal exports thence were the matte tea and
timber. In the pastoral country the Jesuits did not
expand farther. They had already gathered most
of the Indians who inhabited that region into their
missions, and the natural increase of population did
not justify any new settlements. But in the wooded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
country across the Paran&aacute; a few tribes of Guaranies
had hitherto escaped subjection to either Creoles or
Jesuits, and farther to the west, in the great Chaco,
there were many tribes of savage and intractable
Indians. In both these directions the Jesuits kept
up their missionary efforts. In Paraguay, they
were successful and converted many tribes of the
northern part of that country, but in the Chaco they
could make little progress.</p>

<p>In 1769 the king of Spain issued his famous decree
banishing the Jesuits from all his dominions.
It was feared that in the centre of their power on the
Upper Paran&aacute; they might offer resistance. They
commanded a population of more than two hundred
thousand Indians, fairly well armed and disciplined
and absolutely devoted to them; nevertheless, they
submitted quietly. Spanish officials replaced the
Jesuits in control of the civil and commercial interests
of the mission towns, and priests of other Orders
were sent up to continue spiritual instruction. The
Spanish officials were, however, not successful in
holding the Indians together. Their exactions and
cruelties drove the Indians to despair, and within a
very few years emigration began. The seven missions
to the east of the Uruguay had been traded by
Spain to Portugal in 1750, and most of their inhabitants
had then been killed or driven across the Uruguay.
The most populous missions lay between the
Uruguay and the Paran&aacute;, in the territory that to-day
forms the upper part of Corrientes, and the
Missions Territory. A large proportion of their inhabitants
fled down the Uruguay into Entre Rios<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and Uruguay proper. Those on the west side of
the Paran&aacute; largely remained or removed only far
enough to coalesce with the secular Indians of Paraguay;
some of the outlying and more remote missions
were abandoned altogether, and Paraguay then
assumed its present extent.</p>

<p>The population was fairly homogeneous, and its
vast majority was composed of descendants of the
aborigines, with comparatively few Spaniards and
Creoles of mixed blood forming the upper strata of
society. The country felt few of the quickening
and disturbing influences which were already animating
the regions at the mouth of the river toward
the end of the eighteenth century. Little effort
was necessary to get a subsistence from the teeming
soil, and, content with their luscious oranges, their
matte, and their unlimited tobacco, the Paraguayans
led an idyllic existence. They had little sympathy
with the turbulent, active-minded population which
was crowding into Buenos Aires and making it a
commercial, political, and intellectual focus. Agricultural
in their habits, they disliked the hard-riding
gauchos of the southern plains hardly less than the
turbulent Indians of the Chaco. In the movements
that preceded the revolution of 1810 they took no
part.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>FRANCIA'S REIGN</h3>


<p>On the 25th of May, 1810, a revolutionary movement
in Buenos Aires overthrew the Spanish
Viceroy. Its leaders were young Creole liberals,
natives of Buenos Aires, and a junta was formed
from their number which undertook the supreme
direction of affairs. Prompt measures were taken
to overthrow the Spanish provincial authorities and
to secure the co-operation and obedience of all the
subdivisions of the Viceroyalty. Manuel Belgrano,
one of the enthusiastic leaders of the movement,
was sent up the river to take possession of Entre
Rios and Corrientes for the junta, and to attack the
Spanish governor of Paraguay. He was accompanied
by only a few hundred troops, but he counted
on the sympathy and help of the people among
whom he was going.</p>

<p>In Entre Rios and Corrientes, which were mere
administrative divisions of the province of Buenos
Aires, he encountered no difficulty. The gauchos,
who formed almost the whole population, hated
outside control and cared little who claimed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
supreme at Buenos Aires. Belgrano marched
through the centre of these districts and reached
the Paran&aacute; at the old Jesuit capital of Candelaria.
Once across the river he found a different atmosphere.
The home-loving Indian population regarded
Belgrano's band as invaders and responded
promptly to the call of the Spanish governor, old
Velasco, to take up arms and repel the aggression.
The Paraguayans hated the Buenos Aireans with an
intensity born of ignorance and isolation, and a considerable
force of militia assembled for the defence
of Asuncion. Among its most popular leaders was
a native Paraguayan named Yegros. Belgrano was
not opposed until he approached within sixty miles
of Asuncion, but on the 19th of January, 1811, the
Paraguayans turned and crushed his little army.
He retreated to the south and on March 9th was
captured with his whole force.</p>

<p>This repulse ended, once for all, the hope cherished
by the Buenos Aires liberals of persuading or compelling
the submission of Paraguay. The battle of
the 19th of January, and the hostile attitude of the
whole Paraguayan people, definitely assured Paraguay's
independence from Buenos Aires. It soon
became evident that independence from Spain had
been secured as well. In contact with their Argentine
prisoners, the more intelligent Paraguayan
leaders were quickly convinced of the advantages
which home rule would bring to Paraguay, and that
they themselves ought to control the government until
affairs in Spain should be settled. The governor
had no Spanish troops nor any hope of receiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
help, either from the distracted mother-country or
from the governors of other parts of South America.
Each of them had enough to do in taking
care of himself. Velasco's secretary was an educated
Buenos Airean, a liberal, and an autonomist.
He plotted the overthrow of his chief in connection
with a Paraguayan officer who was popular with the
troops in Asuncion.</p>

<p>Two months after Belgrano's surrender, a bloodless
revolution occurred. The governor offered no
resistance; he simply stepped to one side and became
a private citizen, while the patriots took possession
of the barracks and began casting about blindly for
a solid basis for a new government. After a good
deal of confusion the prominent citizens of the province
were called together in a sort of rude Constituent
Congress, and a junta was formed. General
Yegros and Dr. Francia were the two most prominent
and popular men in the country, and they were
naturally and inevitably selected as chief members.
Yegros had been the principal leader of the militia,
and Francia was considered the most learned and
able man in the community. He was a lawyer who
had become a sort of demigod to the lower classes
by his fearless advocacy of their rights, and inspired
almost superstitious reverence by his reputation for
learning and disinterestedness. He was selected as
secretary, while Yegros, an ignorant soldier, became
president of the junta. Francia's abilities and courage
immediately made him the dominating figure.
Jealousies arose and he stepped out for a while, but
the weaker men who succeeded him could not con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>trol
the situation. Two years later a popular assembly
met which was ready to submit to his advice
in everything. The junta was dismissed and he and
Yegros were invested with supreme power under the
title of Consuls. A year later he forced Yegros out
and with general consent assumed the position of
sole executive, and in 1816 he was formally declared
supreme and perpetual dictator.</p>

<p>For the next twenty-five years he was the Government
of Paraguay. History does not record another
instance in which a single man so dominated and
controlled a people. A solitary, mysterious figure,
of whose thoughts, purposes, and real character little
is known, the worst acts of his life were the most
picturesque and alone have been recorded. Although
the great Carlyle includes him among the
heroes whose memory mankind should worship, the
opinion of his detractors is likely to triumph. Francia
will go down to history as a bloody-minded, implacable
despot, whose influence and purposes were
wholly evil. After reading all that has been written
about this singular character, my mind inclines more
to the judgment of Carlyle. I feel that the vivid
imagination of the great Scotchman has pierced the
clouds which enshrouded the spirit of a great and
lonely man and has seen the soul of Francia as he
was. Cruel, suspicious, ruthless, and heartless as
he undeniably became, his acts will not bear the interpretation
that his purposes were selfish or that he
was animated by mere vulgar ambition.</p>

<p>The population over which he ruled had for centuries
been trained to obedience by the Jesuits and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the Creole landowners. The Creoles were few and
the Spaniards still fewer. Francia based his power
upon the Indian population and not on the little
aristocracy whose members boasted of white blood.
Convinced that the Indians were not fit for self-government,
he also believed that it would be disastrous
to permit the white oligarchy to rule. He
proposed to save Paraguay from the civil disturbances
that distracted the rest of South America.
He therefore absorbed all power in his own hands
and ruthlessly repressed any indications of insubordination
among those of Spanish blood. The Indians
blindly obeyed him, and he relentlessly pursued
the Creoles and the priests, seeming to regard them
only as dangerous firebrands who might at any time
start up a conflagration in the peaceful body politic,
and not as citizens entitled to the protection of the
State.</p>

<p>He absorbed in his own person all the functions
of government; he had no confidants and no assistants;
he allowed no Paraguayan to approach him on
terms of equality. When he died, a careful search
failed to reveal any records of the immense amount
of governmental business which he had transacted
during thirty years. The orders for executions were
simply messages signed by him and returned, to be
destroyed as soon as they had been carried out.
The longer he lived the more completely did he
apply his system of absolutism, and the more confident
he became that he alone could govern his people
for his people's good. He adopted a policy of
commercial isolation, and intercourse with the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>side
world was absolutely forbidden. Foreigners
were not permitted to enter the country without a
special permit, and once there were rarely allowed
to leave.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
</div>

<p>He neither sent nor received consuls nor ministers
to foreign nations. Foreign vessels were excluded
from the Paraguay River and allowed to visit only
one port in the south-eastern corner of the country.
He was the sole foreign merchant. The communistic
system inherited from the Jesuits was developed and
extended to the secular parts of the country. The
government owned two-thirds of the land and conducted
great farms and ranches in various parts of
the territory. If labour was needed in gathering
crops, Francia had recourse to forced enlistment.
Those Indian missions which remained free he
brought gradually under his own control and followed
the old Jesuit policy of compelling the wild
Indians to work like other citizens. Dreading interference
by Spain, Brazil, or Buenos Aires, he improved
the military forces and began the organisation
of the whole population into a militia. His policy,
however, was peaceful, and the difficulty of getting
arms up the river, past the forces of the Argentine
warring factions, prevented his organising an army
fit for offensive operations even if he had desired to
have one.</p>

<p>As he grew older he became more solitary and
ferocious. Always a gloomy and peculiar man, absorbed
in his studies and making no account of the
ordinary pleasures and interests of mankind, he had
reached the age of fifty-five and assumed supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
power, without marrying. His public labours still
further cut him off from thoughts of family and
friends; and, although it has been asserted that he
married a young Frenchwoman when he was past
seventy, nothing is known about her. It is certain
that he left no children and died attended only by
servants. His severities against the educated classes
increased; he suffered from frequent fits of hypochondria;
he ordered wholesale executions, and seven
hundred political prisoners filled the jails when he
died. His moroseness increased year by year. He
feared assassination and occupied several houses,
letting no one know where he was going to sleep
from one night to another, and when walking the
streets kept his guards at a distance before and behind
him. Woe to the enemy or suspect who attracted
his attention! Such was the terror inspired
by this dreadful old man that the news that he was
out would clear the streets. A white Paraguayan
literally dared not utter his name; during his lifetime
he was "El Supremo," and after he was dead
for generations he was referred to simply as "El
Defunto." For years when men spoke of him they
looked behind them and crossed themselves, as if
dreading that the mighty old man could send devils
to spy upon them,&mdash;at least this is the story of
Francia's enemies who have made it their business
to hand his name down to execration. The real
reason may have been that Francia's successors regarded
defamation of "El Defunto" as an indication
of unfriendliness to themselves.</p>

<p>Devil or saint, hypochondriac or hero, actuated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
morbid vanity or by the purest altruism, there is no
difficulty in estimating the results of Francia's work
and the extent of his abilities. That he had a will
of iron and a capacity beyond the ordinary is proven
by his life before he became dictator, as well as his
successes afterwards. All authorities agree that he
had acquired as a lawyer a remarkable ascendancy
over the common people by his fearlessness in maintaining
their causes before the courts and corrupt
officials. He did not rise by any sycophant arts;
indeed, he never veiled the contempt he felt for the
party schemers and officials around him. When he
had supreme power in his hands he used it for no
selfish indulgences. His life was austere and abstemious;
parsimonious for himself, he was lavish for
the public. He would accept no present, and either
returned those sent him, or sent back their value in
money. Though he had been educated for the
priesthood and had never been out of South America
he had absorbed liberal religious principles from his
reading. Nothing could have been more likely to
offend the Catholic Indians, upon whose good will
his power rested, than his refusal to attend mass,
but he was honest enough with himself and with
them not to simulate a sentiment which he did not
feel. In his manners and life he was absolutely
modest; he received any who chose to see him; if
he was terrible it was to the wealthy and the powerful;
the humblest Indian received a hearing and
justice. During his reign Paraguay remained undisturbed,
wrapped in a profound peace; the population
rapidly increased, and though commerce and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
manufactures did not flourish, nor the new ideas
which were transforming the face of the civilised
world penetrate within his barriers, food and clothing
were plenty and cheap, and the Paraguayans
prospered in their own humble fashion. Though
they might not sell their delicious matte, there was
no limitation on its domestic use, and although
money was not plentiful and foreign goods were a
rarity, a fat steer could be bought for a dollar, and
want was unknown.</p>

<p>The old man lived until 1840 in the full possession
of unquestioned supreme power, dying at the age of
eighty-three years. His final illness lasted only a
few days, and he went on attending to business to
the very end. When asked to appoint a successor
he refused, bitterly saying that there would be no
lack of heirs. His legitimate and natural successor
could only be that man who could raise himself
through the mass by his force of character and
prove himself capable of dominating the disorganising
elements of Creole society.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE REIGN OF THE ELDER LOPEZ</h3>


<p>Once the breath was out of the old man's body,
his secretary attempted to seize the government.
He concealed Francia's death for several
hours and issued orders in the dead man's name.
But as soon as the news came out, the army officers,
whose assistance was essential, refused to obey him.
The poor secretary escaped a worse fate by hanging
himself in prison, and the troops amused themselves
setting up and pulling down would-be dictators.
After several months of anarchy, it was determined
to assemble a Congress in imitation of the first Congress
which had named Francia consul. A real
representative government was, of course, impossible
in Paraguay, but the Creoles, who naturally
formed the bulk of the Congress, were desirous of
insuring themselves against another dictatorship.
They wanted a government where the offices would
be passed around. However, an executive was
necessary and the only executive they knew was an
irresponsible one. The title borne by Yegros and
Francia in the early days seemed a good one, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
so it was agreed that two consuls should be elected
for a limited period, during which, however, they
were to exercise very limited power.</p>

<p>Among the ambitious and turbulent deputies a
directing spirit arose in the person of Carlos Antonio
Lopez, a well-to-do rancher who had received a
lawyer's education and had been careful to keep out
of public view during Francia's reign. At this juncture
he inevitably came to the front, because he was
the most learned and far-sighted among his fellow
Creoles. He was a man of great natural ability and
shrewdness, highly intelligent, well read, agreeable
and affable in his manners. Selected as one of the
two Consuls by the Congress of 1841, he soon pushed
his colleague to one side, and became dominant.
In 1844 an obsequious Congress which had been
summoned by him and whose members he virtually
named, conferred upon him the title of President
for the nominal term of ten years, which really was
intended to be for life. It is, however, significant of
the milder character of Lopez and the increased
power of the office-holding class that he preferred
the more republican title of President, held for a
nominally limited period, to the semi-monarchical
one of "El Supremo," borne by his terrible predecessor.
As a matter of fact, Lopez succeeded
to all the absolute power and prerogatives of
Francia.</p>

<p>The new ruler was no such determined <i>doctrinaire</i>
as Francia. He was rather a clever opportunist than
a gloomy idealist. He adopted many liberal measures,
such as the law providing that all negroes there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>after
born should be free, and he even attempted
to frame a regular constitution. He abandoned the
policy of isolation, so dear to Francia, and opened
the country in 1845. He loved appreciation and
especially wished the approbation of foreigners.
Though cautious and reluctant to engage in outside
complications, he was by nature and taste a diplomat,
and he welcomed the opportunity to try his wits
in wider competition than Paraguay afforded. In
1844, Rosas, the tyrant of Buenos Aires, was engaged
in a contest with revolutionists in Corrientes.
His ultimate purpose was manifestly to unite the
whole Plate valley under his authority. Lopez
shared the uneasiness of other neighbouring rulers
at the growth of Rosas's power. The latter promulgated
a decree forbidding the navigation of the
Paran&aacute; to any but Argentine vessels. This decree
was an attack on Paraguay's very plain and natural
right to reach the ocean, and absolutely shut her
off from the outside world. Lopez resented the
aggression, and after many protests declared war
against Buenos Aires in 1849. Nothing came of it,
however, except to give his oldest son a chance to
see actual service and to emphasise Lopez's enmity
to Rosas and his policy. The way was prepared
for his friendship with Urquiza, the great leader of
the Argentine provincials, and for the opening of
Paraguay to foreign commerce.</p>

<p>Permission was granted in 1845 for foreign ships
to ascend the Paraguay as far as Asuncion, and
foreigners were no longer forbidden to enter the
country. On the contrary, Lopez evinced a marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
desire for their society and encouraged them to
come and engage in trade. His manners were engaging
and his courtesies untiring, unless his will
was crossed or his suspicions aroused, when he
could be very unreasonable and arbitrary.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Paraguayan Creoles had been so
broken by the terrible proscriptions of Francia's
reign that Lopez did not experience much difficulty
in ruling them. His milder methods and the terror
of a renewal of the cruelties of Francia's time succeeded
in holding all demonstrations of lawlessness
or rebellion in check. He was averse to shedding
blood, and his subjects enjoyed substantial liberty
in their goings and comings. Justice was well and
regularly administered, and life and property were
almost absolutely safe. Over every kind of affairs,
however, he exercised a patriarchal supervision.
One trustworthy traveller tells of being waited on
at table in a remote part of Paraguay by a fine-appearing
man whose face was very sad and who
seemed very awkward in handling the dishes. On
inquiry, it turned out that the waiter was the richest
man in eastern Paraguay and had been condemned
by the President to serve in a menial capacity as a
punishment for insulting a woman. Lopez's ideas
of freedom did not contemplate that his people
might engage in politics or the discussion of any
public affairs. During the civil war in Corrientes,
Paraguayans were forbidden to speak of what was
going on across the river. Sometimes farmers were
required to cultivate a certain area in a certain crop.
He maintained the government monopoly of yerba<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and completed Francia's work of incorporating the
free Indians.</p>

<p>An instance of his ready interest in foreigners was
his connection with a young American, named Hopkins,
who had been sent out in 1845 by the United
States Government to investigate the advisability of
recognising Paraguay, then accessible for the first
time. This enterprising young man fired Lopez's
imagination with his accounts of the material progress
of the United States, and Lopez even lent him
money to return and form a company for the purpose
of introducing American goods and cigar manufacture
into Paraguay. Hopkins, after several years,
succeeded in interesting some American capitalists
and came back and established his factory. At first
Lopez was delighted, but he soon quarrelled with
the Americans. The etiquette in Paraguay was that
the President should remain seated with his hat on
when he granted an audience, and the manners of
the visitor were expected to be correspondingly
humble. The Americans mortally offended him
by forgetting themselves in his presence. The
situation soon became intolerable and the company
retired.</p>

<p>After the overthrow of Rosas in 1851 the Paran&aacute;
was declared free for navigation to vessels of all
nations by Argentine law and by treaties to which
Brazil and Uruguay were parties, although Paraguay
was not. Nevertheless, Lopez permitted ships to
ascend freely to Asuncion. Lopez wished to concentrate
all trade at Asuncion and opened no ports
north of his capital. The upper course of the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
belonged to Brazil, but the boundary between Brazil
and Paraguay had remained unsettled from colonial
times. In his control of the Lower Paraguay, Lopez
had a lever to force Brazil to terms. He steadfastly
refused to permit ships to ascend into Brazil in spite
of the latter's persistent efforts to procure the natural
and necessary right of egress to the ocean by an
international river. While this matter still remained
unsettled, Lieutenant Page of the United States
Navy appeared in the <i>Water Witch</i> at Asuncion on
his survey of the Paraguay. Lopez was delighted,
and extended every facility to the officer as far as
the northern boundary of Paraguay. Page went on
up to Brazil. Lopez was offended, for he feared
that he would be at a disadvantage in his further
negotiations with Brazil by having apparently granted
to an American ship the permission which he had
steadily refused to Brazilians. Unfortunately, just
at this time occurred the quarrel with the American
promoter, Hopkins. The American officer took his
countryman's side, giving him refuge on board the
<i>Water Witch</i>. This so enraged Lopez that he issued
a decree prohibiting foreign war-vessels from entering
Paraguayan waters, and one of his forts fired at
the Lieutenant's vessel, killing a man. This outrage
brought about Lopez's ears a naval expedition
which compelled him to apologise and to agree to
reimburse the Hopkins Company.</p>

<p>Brazil also sent a fleet up the Paran&aacute; to coerce
Lopez into granting free transit along the Paraguay,
but he cleverly held the Brazilians in parley until he
had an opportunity to fortify the river. England's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
gunboats at Buenos Aires virtually held the Paraguayan
flagship, with Lopez's eldest son on board as
hostage for a young British subject named Canstatt,
who had been imprisoned and condemned to death
for complicity in a conspiracy at Asuncion. Lopez
was forced to release him and pay damages.</p>

<p>These humiliations changed his love for foreigners
into a bitter hatred, and he began to prepare his
country to resist their aggressions more effectively.
From his youth he had trained his sons to succeed
him. Francisco, the eldest, early evinced a taste
for military affairs. When only eighteen years of
age, he commanded the expedition of 1849 into the
Argentine, and thenceforward continued to be his
father's general-in-chief and minister-of-war and
the active agent in improving Paraguay's military
resources. The second son, Venancio, was commander
of the garrison at Asuncion, and the third,
Benigno, was Admiral. Though so rigid with his
other subjects, he gave both his sons and daughters
unlimited license and they grew up to regard themselves
as members of a royal family. They enriched
themselves at the public expense. The sons took
as many mistresses as they pleased and gave free
rein to all their cruel and bad instincts. The selfishness,
obstinacy, unspeakable cruelty, and hard-heartedness
of Francisco were soon to bring the
guiltless Paraguayan people to the verge of extinction.</p>

<p>In 1854 Lopez had sent Francisco to Europe as
ambassador. The young man spent eighteen months
in the different Courts of Europe, and returned an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
expert in the vices of great capitals and enamoured
of military glory. After seeing the reviews of European
armies, he became convinced that Paraguay
could be made an efficient military power and that
he himself might play a Napoleonic r&ocirc;le in South
America. His father, exasperated by the repeated
humiliations put upon him by other countries, gave
hearty support to his plans for the improvement of
the Paraguayan army. In 1862, after a long and
painful illness, the elder Lopez died. Francisco
took possession of his effects and papers and produced
a will naming himself Vice-President. Word
sent to the military chiefs of the different towns
insured the assembling of an obedient Congress at
Asuncion, by which he was formally elected and
proclaimed President and invested with all the absolute
power wielded by his father and Francia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE WAR</h3>


<p>The new President was thirty-five years old,
good-looking, careful of his appearance, fond
of military finery, and strutted as he walked. He
spoke French and Spanish fluently, but with his
officers and men used only Guarany. He was an
eloquent speaker and had the gift of inspiring his
troops with confidence in himself and contempt for
the enemy. He had a will of iron; his pride was
intense; he was absolutely unscrupulous, and had
no regard for the truth. He never showed any
feeling of kindness to his most devoted subjects.
He ordered his best friends to execution; he tortured
his mother and sisters and murdered his brothers.
The only natural affection he ever evinced was a
fondness for Madame Lynch, a woman whom he had
picked up in Paris, and for her children. He seems
to have treated her well to the last, but his numerous
other mistresses and their children he heartlessly
abandoned. Though physically an arrant coward,
no defeats could discourage him. He fought to the
last against overwhelming odds and was able to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>tain
his personal ascendancy over his followers, even
after he had been driven into the woods and all
reasonable hope was lost.</p>

<p>He began his reign like a Mahometan sultan by
ridding himself of his father's most trusted counsellors,
imprisoning and executing the most intelligent
and powerful citizens, and banishing his brothers.
The military preparations which he had begun as
his father's Minister of War were continued with increased
vigour. The warlike Argentines and Uruguayans
and the powerful empire of Brazil laughed
at his pretensions to become a real factor in South
American international affairs, but their laughter
soon cost them dear. He was a monarch of a compact
little state whose position behind rivers in the
centre of the continent made it admirably defensible.
Its eight hundred thousand inhabitants were obedient,
brave, and physically vigorous. Accustomed
for generations to regard their dictator as the greatest
ruler in the world, knowing no duty except absolute
compliance with his will, they never doubted that
under his leadership they would be invincible. He
knew that he could raise an army out of all proportion
to the size of his country. The problem was
how to arm it. With Buenos Aires commanding
the only route of ingress from abroad it had been
difficult for his father and himself to obtain war
material from Europe. For years, however, they
had been buying all that they could and had accumulated
several hundred cannon, most of them antiquated
cast-iron smooth-bores. They had fortified
the point of Humait&aacute; which admirably protected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the Paraguay River from naval attacks, and had
established an arsenal at Asuncion.</p>

<p>Against Brazil Lopez had serious cause of complaint.
The boundary question was still unsettled
and his possession of the Lower Paraguay placed
the great province of Matto Grosso at his mercy,
while the existence of that province, geographically
a mere northern extension of Paraguay, was a menace
to his own safety. Against the Argentines his
hatred was not so well founded, but none the less
bitter.</p>

<p>The usual civil war was going on in Uruguay in
1863. The party which held the capital was out of
favour at Rio and at Buenos Aires, and Brazil and
Argentine were both inclined to support the pretensions
of Flor&eacute;s, who led the revolutionists.
Lopez thought that his own interests were concerned
and asserted his right to be consulted as to
Uruguayan affairs. A mighty shout of laughter
went up from the Buenos Aires press at the pretensions
of the cacique of an Indian tribe to the position
of guardian of the equilibrium of South America.
Brazil ignored his protests and calmly went on with
her preparations to establish her prot&eacute;g&eacute; in Montevideo.
In the beginning of 1864 Lopez began active
preparations for war. His army already numbered
twenty-eight thousand men, and by the end of
August sixty-four thousand more had been enrolled
and drilled. Although ill provided with artillery
and horses, and although the infantry were mostly
armed with old-fashioned flintlocks, no such formidable
force had ever assembled in South America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The news of Lopez's preparations exasperated and
somewhat alarmed the people of Buenos Aires,
though no one knew his exact intentions. Lopez
had, in fact, determined to compel the Brazilian
and Argentine governments to accept his wishes as
to Uruguay or to risk all in the hazard of war.
Perhaps hazy dreams of himself as emperor of a
domain extending from the southern sources of the
Amazon far down the Plate valley and over to the
Atlantic coast passed through his brain. Possibly
he foresaw clearly that Paraguay had come to the
parting of the ways, and that she must either fight
her way to the sea or reconcile herself to slow suffocation
between the immense masses of Brazil and
Argentina. In such a contest the only allies he
could hope for would be revolutionary factions in
Uruguay and Corrientes, and possibly the virtually
independent ruler of Entre Rios. In case of a war
with Brazil alone, the neutrality of Argentina might
have been secured by careful management, but in
the freer countries the feeling against him as a
despot was strong, and the extension of his system
would have been regarded as a menace to civilisation.</p>

<p>Late in 1864 the Brazilian forces marched into Uruguay
and joined Flor&eacute;s. Lopez promptly retaliated
by seizing a Brazilian steamer which was passing
Asuncion on its way to Matto Grosso and followed up
this aggression by an invasion of the latter province.
His forces quickly reduced the towns on the banks
of the Paraguay as far as steamers could penetrate.
It was impossible to send reinforcements overland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
from Rio; Brazil's counter-attack must be delivered
from the south. The empire was unprepared, but
its troops poured into Uruguay and Rio Grande as
fast as they could be mobilised. The anti-Flor&eacute;s
party were crushed by the siege and capture of
Paysandu late in 1864. The Argentine government
under Mitre proclaimed its neutrality. Lopez was
flushed with his easy success in Matto Grosso. The
forces he had on foot overwhelmingly outnumbered
those of the Brazilians in Uruguay and Rio Grande.
He wished to strike the latter before they could be
re-enforced, overrun Rio Grande, and, as master of
one of Brazil's most valuable provinces, dictate
terms. To reach the Brazilians it was necessary to
cross the Argentine province of Corrientes. He
asked for permission to do so and Mitre refused.
Notwithstanding the risk involved, he promptly decided
to finish up both Argentine and Brazil at the
same time. Sending his troops across the Paran&aacute;
he virtually annexed Corrientes and declared war
on Buenos Aires. Lopez destined twenty-five
thousand men for the invasion of Corrientes and
the conquest of the Lower Uruguay valley, but the
difficulties of getting so large an army across the
river and ready for an advance into a hostile country
were unexpectedly great. The gauchos of Corrientes,
trained for generations in civil wars, quickly
assembled to oppose the Paraguayans. Meanwhile,
a Brazilian fleet came up; and, on June 2, 1865, at
Riachuelo, decisively defeated the Paraguayan naval
forces. Lopez thereby lost all hope of commanding
the river. The communications of his army in Cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>rientes
might be cut off at any time and an advance
became impossible. The battle of Riachuelo threw
Paraguay on the defensive and made Lopez's great
plan of carrying the war to the Uruguay impracticable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">FRANCISCO SOLANO LOPEZ.<br />
[From a photograph taken in 1849.]</span>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, Lopez did not recall the twelve
thousand men he had sent across the missions to
invade the valley of the Upper Uruguay and the
state of Rio Grande. The Brazilians were taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
unprepared, and early in August the Paraguayans
had captured the chief Brazilian town in that region&mdash;Uruguayana.
The failure of the Corrientes army
to reach the Lower Uruguay left the route up that
river free. The Brazilian and Uruguayan army,
which had been victorious at Paysand&uacute;, marched up
the west bank and defeated and destroyed the rear-guard
which the Paraguayans had left on the Argentine
side opposite Uruguayana. Lopez's army was
therefore cut off from retreat. It was promptly
surrounded, and on the 17th of September, 1865,
had to surrender.</p>

<p>This put an end to Lopez's plan of an offensive
campaign. Indignant at the invasion of her soil,
Argentina had allied herself with Brazil against him.
A secret treaty was signed between Brazil, Argentina,
and Flor&eacute;s, now recognised as ruler of Uruguay,
to prosecute the war to a finish, to depose Lopez
from his throne, and to disarm the Paraguayan
fortifications. Lopez withdrew his army from Corrientes
and concentrated all his forces in the south-west
angle of his own territory.</p>

<p>The position was admirable for defence. North
of the Paran&aacute; and east of the Paraguay stretched a
low, wooded country subject to overflow, and intersected
by shallow, mud-bottomed lagoons, which
were old abandoned beds of the rivers. The Paraguay
protected his right flank and afforded him
a direct and easy communication with Asuncion.
Batteries on the point of Humait&aacute;, which the Brazilian
fleet did not dare to try to pass, insured this
line of communication. West of the Paraguay the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
great Chaco, there impenetrable, prevented a movement
to get north of Humait&aacute; on that side. To the
east the swamps along the Paran&aacute; extended indefinitely,
and an advance of the enemy in that
direction would have had its communications cut by
an army encamped near Humait&aacute;. Humait&aacute; was,
therefore, the key to the situation, and the allies
could not advance until they captured it or, by running
the batteries with their fleet, destroyed Lopez's
control of the Paraguay.</p>

<p>By March, 1866, the allies had concentrated a
force of forty thousand men just south of the fork
of the rivers. About twenty-five thousand were
Brazilians, twelve thousand Argentines and three
thousand Uruguayans. The Brazilian fleet, numbering
eighteen steam gunboats carrying one hundred
and twenty-five guns, lay near at hand ready
to co-operate. Protected by the fire of the gunboats,
the whole allied army had little difficulty in
crossing the Paran&aacute; and establishing itself on Paraguayan
soil. Lopez lost heavily in vain attempts
to prevent this landing. On May 2nd, a force of
Paraguayans surprised the allies a few miles north
of the river and badly cut up the vanguard. The
allies, however, continued advancing and took a
strong position just south of a great lagoon. Here,
on the 24th of May, they were attacked by the
whole Paraguayan army of twenty-five thousand
men, who fought with desperate valour, but at a
hopeless disadvantage. A quarter of the Paraguayan
soldiers were left dead on the field, and
another quarter were badly wounded, while the loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of the allies was half as great. The Paraguayan
army was apparently destroyed, but the allies had
suffered so severely, and the difficulties of transportation
through the swamps were so great, that
they did not make the sudden dash upon the
trenches at Humait&aacute; which might have ended the
war. Lopez did his utmost to reorganise his army.
Practically the whole male population was impressed
into service. The river line of communication to
Asuncion, and the strategic railroad thence up into
the most fertile and populous interior of the country,
enabled him comfortably to command all the resources
of the country, both in men and provisions.</p>

<p>Humait&aacute; had already been well fortified on the
land side, and Lopez now threw up the trenches at
the top of the bluff at Curupayty, the first high land
on the Paraguay River north of the allied army and
south of Humait&aacute;, and connected it with the latter
fortress. Lopez had the advantage of the services
of a clever English civil engineer; and the fortifications,
though rude, were soon made practically impregnable
to assault. In spite of their defeats, the
Paraguayans were as ready as ever to attack when
Lopez commanded, or to stand up and be shot down
to the last man. They were the most obedient soldiers
imaginable; they never complained of an injustice
and never questioned an order when given.
Even if a soldier were flogged, he consoled himself
by saying, "If my father did not flog me, who
would?" Every one called his superior officer his
"father," and Lopez was the "Great Father."
Each officer was responsible with his life for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
faithfulness and conduct of his men and had orders
to shoot any that wavered. Each soldier knew that
the men who touched shoulders with him right and
left were instructed to shoot him if he tried to desert
or fly, and those two knew that the men beyond
them would shoot them if they failed to kill the
poor fellow in the centre of the five. This cruel
system answered perfectly with the Paraguayans,
and to the very end of the war they never refused
to fight steadily against the most hopeless odds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the allies awaited reinforcements and
supplies in the noisome swamps, dying meantime
by thousands of fever. By the end of June, when
the allies finally determined to assault the fortifications
around Humait&aacute;, Lopez had twenty thousand
men on the ground. After some bloody and indecisive
fighting in the swamps, General Mitre, the
Commander-in-Chief, ordered a grand attack upon
the entrenchments at Curupayty. On the 22nd of
September, 1866, it began with the bombardment
by the Brazilian ironclads. Eighteen thousand men
in four columns advanced from the south, and threw
themselves blindly against the fortifications. When
they came to close quarters they were thrown into
disorder by the terrible artillery fire from the Paraguayan
trenches, which cross-enfiladed them in
different directions. The enormous canisters discharged
from the eight-inch guns point-blank, at a
distance of two or three hundred yards, wrought
fearful execution. The rifle fire of the allies was
useless, and the Paraguayans simply waited behind
their trenches until the Brazilians and Argentines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
were close at hand and then fired. The allies retired
in good order, after suffering a loss of one-third their
number. The soldiers obediently kept rushing on
to certain death until their officers, seeing that success
was hopeless, told them that they might retreat.
The courage of the Paraguayans had been proved
in their unsuccessful assaults on the allies the year
before, and now the Argentines and Brazilians
showed even in this awful defeat what a stomach
they, too, had for hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>After the battle of Curupayty, nothing was attempted
on either side for fourteen months. Both
sides had had enough of attacking fortified positions.
The Paraguayans lay in Humait&aacute; and the allies occupied
themselves with fortifying their camps. The
imperial government made tremendous exertions to
reinforce the army. The Argentines also did their
best, but the efforts of both were hardly sufficient to
make good the terrible ravages of the cholera, which
by the beginning of May, 1867, had put thirteen
thousand Brazilians in hospitals. It was not until
July that the allies felt themselves again ready to
take the offensive. A division marched up the
Paran&aacute; with the purpose of outflanking Humait&aacute; on
the east, while cavalry raids were sent out to the
north and rendered the outlying positions of the
Paraguayans unsafe. Finally, in November, 1867,
the Brazilian troops succeeded in getting over to the
Paraguay River, north and in the rear of Lopez, and
General Barreto captured and fortified a strong position
on the bank fifteen miles north of Humait&aacute;.
This was fatal to the security and communications
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>of Lopez. He made one more desperate and unsuccessful
assault on the main position of the allies,
and then began to plan to retire toward Asuncion.
At the same time the Brazilian ironclads passed the
batteries at Curupayty, compelling Lopez to withdraw
his troops up the river to Humait&aacute;. The war
became virtually a siege of the latter place, which
was constantly bombarded by the fleet from the
front and by the army from the rear. The Brazilian
position on the river to the north cut Lopez off from
direct river communication with Asuncion, and he
had to transport his supplies on a new road built
in the Chaco swamps. He began preparations to
evacuate Humait&aacute; and retreat to the north. In
January, 1868, Mitre definitely retired from the
command of the allies and was succeeded by the
Brazilian Marshal Caxias. A month later (February
18th) the Brazilian fleet of ironclads finally succeeded
in running the batteries at Humait&aacute;, and after
throwing a few bombs at Asuncion, devoted themselves
to the more useful task of cutting off the
transports to Lopez's army.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<span class="caption">PALM GROVES IN EL CHACO.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Lopez's line of river communication was now
completely at the enemies' mercy, and a large force
could not be maintained at Humait&aacute;. He transported
his army to the right bank of the Paraguay,
recrossing when he got beyond the Brazilian positions.
The garrison of three thousand men which
he left at Humait&aacute; defended itself for six months.
In the meantime, he had fortified a new position less
than fifty miles from Asuncion and accessible across
the country from his base of supplies in central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Paraguay. On his right flank a river battery was
erected which again prevented the Brazilians from
reaching the upper river. Opposite this point, however,
the Chaco is penetrable, and Caxias landed a
force on the west bank and, marching up, crossed
the river in the rear of Lopez's position. The Brazilians
closed in from the north and south on the
few thousand Paraguayans, who were all that survived,
and after several days of desperate fighting,
December 27, 1868, the Brazilians carried Lopez's
position and he fled for his life to the interior, followed
by a thousand men.</p>

<p>Even after such a defeat he was indomitable and
succeeded in gathering another small army which
was pursued and destroyed in August, 1869. Lopez
again escaped and took refuge in the wild and mountainous
regions in the north of Paraguay. The Brazilian
cavalry pursued him relentlessly, but it was
not until March 1, 1870, that he was caught. In an
attempt to escape he was speared by a common
soldier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>PARAGUAY SINCE 1870</h3>


<p>No modern nation has ever come so near to complete
annihilation as Paraguay during her five
years' war against the Triple Alliance. Out of two
hundred and fifty thousand able-bodied men who
were living in 1864, less than twenty-five thousand
survived in 1870. Not less than two hundred and
twenty-five thousand Paraguayan men&mdash;the fathers
and bread-winners, the farmers and labourers&mdash;had
perished in battle, by disease or exposure or starvation.
One hundred thousand adult women had died
of hardship and hunger, and there were less than
ninety thousand children under fifteen in the country.
The surviving women outnumbered the men
five to one; the practice of polygamy naturally
increased, and women were forced to become the
labourers and bread-winners for the community.</p>

<p>The slaughter was greatest in proportion among
the people of white blood. When Lopez was waiting
in 1868 for the final attack of the Brazilians, he
made use of the last months of his power to arrest,
torture, and murder nearly every white man left in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Paraguay, including his own brother, his brother-in-law,
and the generals who had served him best, and
the friends who had enjoyed his most intimate confidence.
Even women and foreigners did not escape
the cold, deliberate bloodthirstiness of this demon.
He had his own sister beaten with clubs and
exposed her naked in the forest; had the wife of
the brave general who was forced to surrender at
Humait&aacute; speared, and subjected two members of
the American Legation to the most sickening tortures.
The Minister himself barely escaped with
his life.</p>

<p>When the Brazilians captured Asuncion in 1868
they installed a provisional triumvirate of Paraguayans,
but the country was really under their
military government until after the death of Lopez.
A new constitution was proclaimed on November
25, 1870, but it was not until a year later that the
provisional government was superseded by Salvador
Jovellanos, the first President. The new President
had no elements with which to establish a government,&mdash;neither
money nor men. The country Paraguayans
refused to recognise his authority and he
was shut up in Asuncion. There were three so-called
revolutions in 1872, which were suppressed
by the Brazilian troops. The country really remained
under a Brazilian protectorate for the first
few years after the war, and the government was
largely a convenience to make treaties and to try to
place loans abroad. Toward the end of 1874 Jovellanos
was succeeded by Gill, and by 1876 the country
was finally enjoying peace and freedom from foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
control. The integrity of Paraguay and her continuance
as an independent power had been mutually
guaranteed by Brazil and Argentina when they began
the war against Lopez, and neither of them
could afford to let the other take possession of her
territory. So Paraguay was left substantially intact,
although she was compelled to give up the
territorial claims the Lopezes had so long made
against Brazil and the Argentine. The latter even
submitted to arbitration her right to a portion of
the Chaco north of the Pilocomayo. President
Hayes was the arbitrator and he decided in favour
of Paraguay in 1878. In the treaty of peace Paraguay
had agreed to bear the war expenses of the
allies and these immense sums are still nominally
due from her. As a matter of fact, she has not
been able to pay anything thereon, and the matter
of forgiving the debt is one frequently discussed in
Brazil.</p>

<p>Population rapidly increased after peace was thoroughly
established, and has more than doubled in
the last thirty years. In the late eighties the influence
of the Buenos Aires boom extended to Paraguay,
and the government offered great inducements
to attract immigration. The movement was not
very successful, but it had the indirect effect of
transferring great tracts of land from government
to private ownership. Previously, two-thirds of
the land belonged to the State. One of the colonies
was composed of socialists from Australia who
promptly split on their arrival over the question of
total abstinence. Those who insisted on being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
allowed to drink were obliged to leave. Subsequently,
disagreements about doctrine and the application
of the principles of socialism drove out
others. The soil of Paraguay is marvellously fertile,
but its isolation and the want of markets for
the national products make it unattractive to European
immigrants.</p>

<p>Happily Paraguay has not suffered from civil disorders
during the slow process of national regeneration
which has been going on since 1870. Most of
the Presidents have served out their full four-years
term, and the one or two changes which have occurred
have not been accompanied by any bloodshed
or interruption in administration. The chief
difficulties of the government have been financial.
Revenue is small and paper currency has been issued
until it is at a discount of several hundred per cent.
compared with its nominal value in gold; but since
foreign commerce is inconsiderable and the population
lives off the products of its own farms the results
of inflation have not been so disastrous as they
might have been in a commercial country.</p>

<p>The wave of twentieth-century progress and immigration
may strike this Arcadian region at any
moment, but up to the present time the body of the
Paraguayans live much as their ancestors. Existence
can be maintained with hardly an effort; the
people can always get oranges in default of more
nourishing food; the climate is lovely; the forests
surrounding the peasant's cabin beautiful. Why
should a Paraguayan work when he can live happily
and comfortably without labour, merely to procure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
things which to him are superfluities? It must be
remembered that the bulk of the Paraguayan people
are descended from the Indians which were found
crowded into this garden spot three centuries ago
by the Spaniards and the Jesuits. They have never
lost their simple, submissive, stoical character, and
the rule of the three dictators did not tend to change
them. The modern improvements of which they
saw most during the reign of Lopez were muskets
and cannon, and they can hardly be blamed for preferring
old-fashioned ways after their experience
during the war. Though the nation was almost
destroyed, the surviving remnants show the same
characteristics which distinguished their ancestors.
The new Paraguay, however, is not ruled by any
bloody-minded despot, and the military possibilities
of the people will never again be a menace to the
liberties of the surrounding nations. Rather is the
present ruling class disposed to welcome foreign influences
and immigration, and this beautiful, fertile,
and easily accessible country stands open to the
world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>The most fertile parts of the globe have always
been fought for the most. Uruguay has been
the Flanders of South America. Her admirable commercial
position at the mouth of the river Plate has
made her capital one of the great emporiums of the
continent. On the track of the world's commerce,
open to the currents of intellectual and industrial
life which sweep from Europe into the luxuriant
country of the southern half of South America or
around to the Pacific, her people have always been
in the vanguard of Spanish-American civilisation.
Her productive, well-watered, and gently rolling
plains are well adapted for agriculture and unsurpassed
for pasturage. Here the Indians struggled
hardest to maintain themselves and longest resisted
the Spanish conquest. From colonial times, Argentines
have crowded in from the west, Brazilians from
the north, and Buenos Aireans and Europeans from
the coast, until this favoured spot has become the
most thickly populated country of South America.</p>

<p>The very strategic and industrial desirability of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
this region, and the ease with which it can be invaded,
have made it the scene of constant armed
conflict. Uruguay has been the cockpit of the
southern half of the continent, and its people have
been fighting continually through the one hundred
and fifty years during which the country has been
inhabited. They fought for their independence
against the Spaniards, then against the Buenos
Aireans, then against the Brazilians, then against
the Buenos Aireans again, and in the intervals they
have fought pretty constantly among themselves.
In colonial times Montevideo was Spain's chief fortress
on this coast, and that city has always been the
favourite refuge for the unsuccessful revolutionists
and exiles from the neighbouring states. The blood
of the bravest and most turbulent Argentines and
Rio Grandenses has constantly mixed with its population.
By habit, tradition, and inheritance the older
generation of Uruguayans in both city and country
are warlike.</p>

<p>Though the military spirit had been vastly stimulated
by peculiar political and racial circumstances,
in later times commercialism has been nourished by
geographical situation and the fertility of the soil
and by European immigration. The interplay of
these contending forces has been producing a marked
people&mdash;a vigorous, turbulent race whose energies
have apparently been chiefly employed in war, but
who have found time in the intervals of foreign
and civil conflict to make their country one of the
wealthiest and most industrially progressive countries
in South America. They are like the Dutch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
in their turbulence and in their eagerness to make
money; and they are also like the Dutch in their
determination to maintain at all hazards their separate
national existence. Nevertheless, the origin of
Uruguay was artificial. The reason for the country's
separation from Buenos Aires was that Brazil
regarded it as unsafe to permit Argentina to spread
north of the Plate.</p>

<p>The territory of Uruguay is that irregular polygon
which is bounded on the south by the Plate estuary;
on the west by the Uruguay River; on the south-east
by the Atlantic; and on the north-east by the artificial
line which separates it from Brazil. Though
the most favoured in soil, climate, and geographical
position, it is the smallest country in South America,
the area being only seventy-three thousand square
miles. In prehistoric days, when a vast inland sea
occupied what is now the Argentine pampa, Uruguay
was the northern shore of the great strait which
opened into the pampean sea. It is the southern
extremity of the eastern continental uplift of South
America. The last outlying ramparts of the Brazilian
mountain system, greatly eroded and planed
down into low-swelling masses little elevated above
the sea, run south-west from Rio Grande into Uruguay,
dipping into the Plate at the southern border.
The north shore of the Plate estuary is bold, and
not flat as is the opposite shore of Buenos Aires.
There are, however, no mountains, properly so-called,
in Uruguay, and nearly the whole surface is
a succession of gently undulating plains and broad
ridges intersected by countless streams, and covered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
for the most part, with luxuriant pasture. The
abundance of wood and water is an immense advantage
to settlers, whether pastoral or agricultural.
The extreme south-western corner, near the mouth
of the Uruguay River, is alluvial. On the Atlantic
coast there are level, marshy plains, due to the slow
secular rising of the land and consequent baring of
the ocean's bed.</p>

<p>The country is easily penetrable in every part.
There are no mountain ridges or dense forests to
interrupt travel, and most of the rivers are easily
fordable. On the west, the broad flood of the Uruguay
River gives easy communication to the ocean,
while it affords protection against sudden invasions
from the Argentine province of Entre Rios. The
low and sandy foreshore of the Atlantic has no harbours,
but after rounding Cape Santa Maria and
entering the estuary of the Plate, there are several
bays which afford some shelter for shipping. Maldonado,
Montevideo, and Colonia are the principal
ports, but the extreme shallowness of the Plate prevents
them from being classed as first-rate harbours
for modern vessels. At Montevideo itself, large
modern steamers must anchor several miles out.</p>

<span class="caption">HARBOUR AT MONTEVIDEO.</span>
</div>

<p>Possibly the present territory of Uruguay was
reached by the Portuguese navigators who reconnoitred
the coast of Brazil in the first few years of
the sixteenth century, but they certainly made no
settlements and left no clear record of their voyagings.
In 1515, Juan Diaz de Solis, Grand Pilot of
Spain, was sent out by Charles V. to reconnoitre
the Brazilian coast in Spanish interests. He did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not land on the shore of Brazil proper, but kept on
to the south until he reached Cape Santa Maria,
which marks the northern side of the entrance to
the river Plate. To his left hand stretched beyond
the horizon a flood of yellow fresh water flowing
gently over a shifting, sandy bottom nowhere more
than a few fathoms below the surface. It was evident
that he was out of the ocean and sailing up a
river of such magnitude as had never been dreamed
of before. He followed along the coast, skirting
the whole southern boundary of what is now the republic
of Uruguay and finally reached the head of
the estuary. Directly from the north the Uruguay,
a river five miles wide, clear and deep, seemed a
continuation of the Plate, but from the west the numerous
channels of the Paran&aacute; delta poured in an
immense muddy discharge double the volume of
the wider river. At the junction was an island which
Solis named <i>Martin Garcia</i> after his pilot. He
resolved to take possession of the country in the
name of the Crown of Castile, and to explore the
coast. He disembarked with nine companions on
the Uruguayan shore: here the little party was unexpectedly
attacked by Indians; Solis and all his
men but one were killed, and the ships sailed back
to Spain without their commander.</p>

<p>Three years later Ferdinand Magellan, on his
epoch-making voyage around the world, visited the
coast of Uruguay. On the 15th of January, 1520,
he came in sight of a high hill overlooking a commodious
bay. This he called Montevideo&mdash;a name
which has been extended to the city which long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
after grew up on the other side of the harbour.
Magellan ascended the estuary, hoping that he might
find a passage through to the Pacific Ocean, but after
he had entered the Uruguay its clear water, rapid
current, and want of tides convinced him that it
was only an ordinary river and not a strait.</p>

<p>Spain determined to take possession of the Plate,
and in 1526 sent out an expedition for that purpose
under Diego Garcia. At the same time Sebastian
Cabot was preparing another expedition, which was
ordered to follow in Magellan's track and to make
observations of longitude on the Atlantic coast of
South America and in the East Indies. Spain and
Portugal had already begun to dispute about the
correct location of the line which they had agreed
should divide the world into a Spanish and a Portuguese
hemisphere, and which was believed to pass
near the Plate. Garcia was delayed on the coast of
Brazil, so Cabot reached the mouth of the estuary
first. The latter had encountered bad weather and
lost his best ship, and when he sighted the coast of
Uruguay his men were discouraged. They remained
in the mouth of the river for some time, and to their
surprise a solitary Spaniard was encountered on the
shore, who proved to be the only survivor of the party
that had gone ashore with Solis ten years before.</p>

<p>Soon Cabot and his men heard tales of silver
mines far up the river, and of the existence of a
great civilised empire on its remote headwaters.
Silver ornaments were shown which had come down
hand to hand from Peru or Bolivia. Cabot determined
to abandon his commission to the Moluccas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and to find the country whence the silver came.
Naturally, his first effort was directed up the broad
channel of the Uruguay, but on ascending this river
it was soon evident that the mines and civilised
country he was seeking did not lie on its banks.
Fifty miles up the river at San Salvador the Spaniards
attempted to establish a little post which is
sometimes referred to as the earliest settlement in
Uruguay or Argentina. It was probably intended
as a mere supply depot and point of refuge, conveniently
near the sea to aid the up-river expedition.
However, the warlike Indians of Uruguay soon left
no trace of it. Cabot entered the Paran&aacute;, where he
spent three years in an unsuccessful effort to reach
Bolivia. He and Garcia sailed back to Spain without
leaving even a settlement behind them, but
they were thoroughly convinced that an adequate
expedition could find the silver country.</p>

<p>The tribes who inhabited Uruguay were the fiercest
Indians encountered by the conquerors of South
America. For two centuries they succeeded in preventing
the establishment of settlements in their
territory and kept out Spanish intruders at the point
of the sword. The Spaniards greatly coveted the
north bank of the Plate and made effort after effort
to get a foothold there, but these savages managed
to maintain themselves for a hundred and fifty years
in the very face of Buenos Aires. The river shore
itself was the last accessible and fertile region to be
subjected to the whites. A century elapsed after
the foundation of Buenos Aires before Colonia was
occupied by the Portuguese, and another fifty years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
went by before Montevideo had been settled and
fortified. Uruguay in pre-Spanish times, as well as
since, was a meeting-ground for different peoples.
One after another the Guarany tribes crowded into
this favoured region from the north and west, and
the old inhabitants had to fight and conquer, or be
thrust into the sea. The bravest, best armed, and
best organised tribes survived in the harsh struggle.
Of the Indians inhabiting Uruguay when the Spaniards
discovered the Plate, the principal ones were
the Charruas. They occupied a zone extending
around from the Atlantic, along the Plate, and a
short distance up the Uruguay. This strong and
valiant race never submitted to the Spaniards, and
when at last they were defeated and crowded back
from the coast well on in the eighteenth century,
they retired to the north and maintained their freedom
for many years. They belonged to the great
family of Tupi-Guaranies, who occupied most of
eastern South America at the white man's advent,
but they were more nomadic in their habits and had
developed the art of war to greater perfection than
the mother tribes of the more tropical parts of South
America.</p>

<p>In their fights against the Spaniards, they sometimes
gathered armies of several hundreds which
fought with a rude sort of discipline, forming in
column and attacking in mass with clubs after discharging
their arrows and stones. Possibly they
learned some of their tactics from the white men,
but it is certain that before the invasion they had
developed a tribal organisation which enabled them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to bring far larger bodies into the field than the
tribes to the north, and that soon after the arrival
of the whites they learned the military uses of the
horse. Personal bravery and fortitude were the virtues
most admired among the Charruas, and they
chose their chiefs from those who had most distinguished
themselves in battle. They did not practise
cannibalism like their brother Guaranies on the Brazilian
coast; they killed defective children at birth;
they were moderate in their eating, lived in huts,
and in winter covered themselves with the skins of
animals. Altogether, they seem to have much resembled
the more warlike tribes among the North
American Indians and to have made the same effective
resistance to the whites as did the Iroquois or
Creeks. Such a fierce and indomitable people terrorised
the Creoles, and settlement proceeded on
lines of less resistance. The coast of Uruguay was
long known as the abode of red demons who showed
little mercy to the adventurous white who dared
build a cabin on the shore, or ride the plains in chase
of cattle. The forts established from time to time
by the Spanish authorities in the early days were invariably
starved out and abandoned, and the white
man obtained a foothold only after the Portuguese
and Spanish governments had fortified towns with
walls, ditches, and artillery, which could be supplied
with provisions from the water side, and after Entre
Rios had been overrun by the gauchos.</p>

<p>Warned by the experiences of Solis and Cabot on
the north shore, Mendoza, the first adelantado of
the Plate, on his arrival in 1535, selected the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
bank of the river as the site of the fortified port
which he proposed to establish at the mouth of the
Paran&aacute; as a base for his projected expedition up the
river. His effort failed completely; he abandoned
Buenos Aires, and the remnants of his expedition
fled to Paraguay and founded Asuncion. In 1573
Zarate, the third adelantado, made a serious effort
to establish a post in Uruguay. He had three hundred
and fifty well-armed Spanish soldiers, more
than the number with which Pizarro had conquered
the empire of Peru, but they were not enough to
make any impression on the Charruas. A company
of forty men hunting wood was set upon and massacred,
and when the main body tried to avenge this
defeat, it, too, was driven back and only escaped to
the island of Martin Garcia after losing a hundred
men. The survivors were rescued by Garay, the most
expert and successful Indian fighter of the time.</p>

<p>This experienced and far-sighted officer wisely
left the Charruas alone and devoted his efforts to
the other side of the river, where, in 1580, he
founded the city of Buenos Aires. Hernandarias,
the Creole governor of Buenos Aires, who shares
with Garay the honour of establishing the Spanish
power in Argentina, and who had already defeated
the Pampa Indians from the Great Chaco in
the north to the Tandil Range in Buenos Aires
province, attempted, in the early years of the
seventeenth century, to subdue the Charruas. He
disembarked at the head of five hundred men in the
western part of Uruguay. Few details of the campaign
which followed have been preserved, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
certain that the Spanish force was destroyed and
that Hernandarias himself barely escaped with his
life. Thenceforth, for more than a century, the
Spaniards made no serious attempts to interfere
with the Charruas; the coast of Uruguay was
shunned by European ships, and the interior remained
absolutely unknown.</p>

<p>It is probable, although not certain, that the
Jesuits on the Upper Uruguay established some villages
of peaceable Indians in the north-western corner
of Uruguay proper, in the middle of the seventeenth
century. A few Indians, it is certain, gathered
under Jesuit control on an island in the Lower Uruguay,
some fifty miles above Martin Garcia, about
1650. This was known as the Pueblo of Soriano,
and is often referred to by Uruguayan historians as
the first permanent settlement in their country.
However, no real progress was made toward getting
possession of Uruguay. The Charruas proved refractory
to Jesuit influence, and only the milder
Yaros and the tribes on the Brazilian border could
be converted.</p>

<p>The horses and cattle which the Spaniards had
introduced multiplied into hundreds of thousands
and roamed undisturbed over the rolling, grassy
plains of Uruguay, and occasionally parties of Creoles
would land on the shore of the Plate and at the risk
of their lives kill some steers and strip them of their
hides. As time went on, the Indians became used
to the white men and some trading sprang up, but
for a full century after Buenos Aires had been in existence
Uruguay remained unsettled by civilised man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PORTUGUESE AGGRESSIONS AND THE SETTLEMENT
OF THE COUNTRY</h3>


<p>In 1680 the governor of Rio de Janeiro sent some
ships and a force of soldiers to the Plate, with
orders to occupy a point on the north bank in the
name of the king of Portugal. Spain claimed that
her dominions extended as far up the coast as the
southern border of the present state of S&atilde;o Paulo,
and Portugal was equally stubborn in insisting that
her rightful territory extended west and south as far
as the mouth of the Uruguay. Neither country had
made any settlements in the disputed region, and
Portugal had determined to take advantage of the
negligence of the Spanish government and be first
in the field. To establish a post only twenty miles
from the capital of the Spanish possessions and
more than a thousand miles south of the last Portuguese
town seemed an audacious step, but its success
would secure for Portugal the whole intermediate
territory, as well as give her a port which would insure
her merchants the command of the trade of the
Plate valley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The Portuguese commander landed unopposed on
the shore of the estuary directly opposite Buenos
Aires, and immediately began to throw up walls,
dig a ditch, and lay out a town called Colonia.
When the news reached Buenos Aires, the indignant
governor raised a force of two hundred and sixty
Spaniards and three thousand Indians, crossed the
river, and fell upon the little body of Portuguese
in the midst of their delving and shovelling. The
attack was at first repulsed, but superior numbers
were soon effective. The enemy surrendered, and
the Spaniards threw down the walls and destroyed
the beginnings of the town. The Portuguese government
protested, claiming that the governor's
action was a wilful and inexcusable aggression
against the forces of a friendly power operating in
territory which had never been occupied by Spain.
The Madrid government disavowed the act, and the
Portuguese resumed possession of Colonia in 1683.
They rebuilt its walls and made the place safe against
the attacks of Indians. At once it became a centre
for contraband traffic. The Spanish laws and colonial
policy forbade vessels to land at Buenos Aires.
In defiance of the prohibition, illegal trade had been
carried on, but the lading of vessels lying in the
Buenos Aires roads was conducted at great risk.
Officials might order the seizure of the goods, and
enormous bribes had to be paid to functionaries;
often the governor was the smuggler's partner, but
he was a partner who demanded an exorbitant share
of the profit. In Colonia, however, merchandise
could be safely stored and embarked at leisure, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the latter place rapidly absorbed the export trade
and became an <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for imported goods destined
for sale in the valley of the Plate and in Bolivia.</p>

<p>Spain had restored Colonia under protest and
without prejudice, explicitly reiterating her own
claim to exclusive proprietorship of the north bank
of the Plate. The diplomatists agreed that the
question of right should remain open for determination
at some future day, but all Spanish subjects
considered the existence of Colonia as a violation
of Spanish soil, and whenever a war broke out in
Europe between the mother countries, the Buenos
Aireans were in the habit of promptly sending an
expedition across the river to capture the Portuguese
town. Three times was it wrenched from the Portuguese,
and three times was it restored on the conclusion
of peace.</p>

<p>In 1705, Spain and Portugal being engaged in
war, the governor of Buenos Aires dislodged the
Portuguese garrison from Colonia and the place remained
in Spanish possession until after the conclusion
of the Peace of Utrecht. Their eleven years'
possession at last convinced the Spaniards that the
settlement of the north bank was feasible. By 1708
the Charrua raids had so far lost their terrors that
the Jesuit mission at Soriano was safely removed
from the island in the Uruguay River to the mainland
opposite. The trade in Uruguayan hides and
horsehair increased, and private expeditions henceforth
frequently crossed the estuary.</p>

<p>It had long been known that the best harbours
on the Uruguayan coast were at Montevideo and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Maldonado, where partially sheltered bays, with
water deep enough for the vessels of the eighteenth
century, were overlooked by beautiful and defensible
town sites. Montevideo is a hundred miles east of
Colonia, and Maldonado another hundred miles
farther on toward the Atlantic. The advisability
of seizing and fortifying one or both of these places
was frequently mooted in Buenos Aires, after the
restoration of Colonia in 1716. Nothing, however,
was done until 1723, when word came that the
Portuguese had again anticipated the Spanish authorities
and had occupied and begun to fortify
Montevideo for themselves. The governor of Buenos
Aires immediately sent an overwhelming force
which compelled the Portuguese to retire. This
time neither dilatory diplomacy nor official ineptitude
prevented his doing the right thing to save Uruguay
to the Spanish Crown, and the following year
he finished the Portuguese walls at Montevideo, and
in 1726 the ground plan of a town was laid out
and a few families were brought from Buenos Aires
and the Canary Islands. Within a few years there
were a thousand people in the place, and it had been
surrounded with walls and defended by artillery.
Four years later, Maldonado was established. No
serious trouble was experienced with the Indians at
either place, and the Spaniards began to spread their
ranches over the neighbouring south-eastern part of
Uruguay.</p>

<span class="caption">MONTEVIDEO.<br />
[From an old print.]</span>
</div>

<p>Almost simultaneously with this important event,
the Creoles from Santa F&eacute; province crossed over
into the wide plains which lie between the Paran&aacute;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>and the Uruguay, and defeated the Charrua tribes
who had kept the Spanish out of that region for one
hundred and fifty years. Soon the gauchos were in
possession of Entre Rios as far as the Uruguay.
The Charruas east of the Uruguay could not prevent
the gauchos from making their way across the
river to build their cabins and ride the plains after
cattle. The settlement of western Uruguay began,
but, except Colonia and Soriano, no towns were
founded. The half-Indian gauchos lived a semi-nomadic
life and needed and received little help from
the authorities in their constant fights against the
Indians.</p>

<p>Shortly after the foundation of Montevideo, a
Portuguese expedition tried to recover the place, but
it was found to be too strong to attack, and the
party resolved to establish a town farther up the
coast. Three hundred miles to the north-west is
found the only opening into the great system of
lagoons which stretches along the seaward side of
Rio Grande do Sul, and at that strategic point the
Portuguese, in 1735, built a fort and town.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century, the situation
between Spain and Portugal in the whole region
between the Plate, the Uruguay, and the sea had
become very strained. Colonia was completely isolated
and the Spaniards controlled all the rest of
Uruguay's western and southern water-front. The
Portuguese settlements in the seaward half of Rio
Grande were prospering and multiplying, soon to
furnish thousands of gauchos, as ready as any who
rode the Argentine pampas to sally forth for war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
or plunder. The territory which the Jesuits had
held for more than a century on the east bank of
the Upper Uruguay lay directly back of these Portuguese
settlements and was more easily accessible
therefrom than from Montevideo. In 1750 Spain
agreed to exchange the Seven Missions for Colonia.
The Portuguese promptly took measures to secure
the ceded territory, attacked the Indian villages, and
massacred or drove off most of the inhabitants.
The Jesuits vigorously protested, and outraged
Spanish public opinion demanded the abrogation of
the treaty, so a few years later the desolated territory
was restored to Spanish possession and Colonia
remained Portuguese.</p>

<p>In 1762 Spain and Portugal were again engaged
in war, and the governor of Buenos Aires attacked
Colonia with a force of twenty-seven hundred men
and thirty-two ships. The fortifications were strong
and the Portuguese offered a tenacious resistance.
After a well-contested siege the place surrendered,
only to be given back to Portugal the ensuing year.
Meanwhile, troops had been sent up from Montevideo
against Rio Grande and the Portuguese settlers
driven back to the north-east corner of the state,
only to rise again when the Spanish troops were gone
and to begin a guerrilla warfare which never ceased
until they had regained their towns.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century had entered on its last
quarter before the Spanish home government took
any real steps to drive the Portuguese out of Colonia
and to reclaim the disputed territory as far north as
S&atilde;o Paulo. The Atlantic slope of Spanish South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
America was erected into a Viceroyalty, and in
1777 the greatest fleet and army ever sent by Spain
to America reached Buenos Aires under command
of the new Viceroy. The Portuguese had no forces
able to cope with his army and fleet, and he carried
all before him. The island of Santa Catharina in
the north of the disputed territory was captured,
Colonia was taken, and an army of four thousand
men started on a triumphal march north-westward
to sweep the Portuguese from the coast. The Spaniards
were at the gates of Rio Grande when news
came that peace had been declared. Orders from
home compelled the Viceroy to stop his northward
progress while the diplomats agreed on a division.
The treaty of San Ildefonso in the main gave each
country the territory its citizens actually occupied.
The Seven Missions remained Spanish, and the
Portuguese were deprived of the southern half of
the great lagoon and of Colonia. Santa Catharina
was restored, and the right of Portugal to the vast
interior and to the regions of the Upper Paran&aacute; and
Paraguay were confirmed. Rio Grande remained
Portuguese and Uruguay was assured of being
thenceforth and for ever Spanish in blood and speech.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>With the treaty of San Ildefonso, Uruguay
began her real existence. Montevideo was
made the greatest fortress on the Atlantic coast,
commanded by its own military governor, strongly
garrisoned and provisioned, and with over one hundred
cannon mounted on its walls. The Charruas
had long been driven back from the coast, and as
soon as the danger of Portuguese interference was
over settlements spread rapidly along the whole
southern border. Prior to 1777 there were only
five towns in Uruguay, but within the next five
years the number tripled. By the year 1810 there
were seventy-five hundred people living in the city
of Montevideo, seventy-five hundred in its immediate
district, and sixteen thousand in the outlying
settlements. Outside of Montevideo, cattle-herding
was the sole business, and the people were a hard-riding,
meat-eating, bellicose race. Immediately to
the north-east lived fifty thousand Rio Grandenses
of Portuguese blood and speech, who, in like surroundings,
had acquired the same pastoral and semi-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>nomadic
habits as their Argentine and Uruguayan
neighbours, and who constantly made incursions
over the Spanish border. The Uruguayan gauchos
retaliated, and for nearly a century continuous
partisan warfare went on, for these half-savage
cattle-herders recked little of treaties or boundary
lines. The Spanish guerrillas bore the name of
<i>blandenques</i>, and in this school of arms the future
generals of Uruguay's war of independence were
trained. Most of the forays were only for the purpose
of stealing cattle or burning cabins built in
coveted regions; nevertheless, one of these expeditions
changed the nationality of a territory larger
than England. In 1801 the Rio Grandenses conquered
the Seven Missions, thus doubling at a single
stroke the area of their own state and reducing
Uruguay to substantially its present dimensions.</p>

<p>As the seat of the largest Spanish garrison, Montevideo
naturally became the centre of pro-Spanish
feeling and influence in the Plate and the home of
families who boasted distinguished Castilian descent
and conservative principles. In the interior
settlements Creole influences predominated, and
the population was substantially homogeneous with
that of the Argentine provinces on the other side
of the Uruguay River. Between the aristocratic
Montevideans and the gauchos of the country districts
there was little sympathy.</p>

<span class="caption">BRIDGE AT MALDONADO.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1806, the English captured Buenos Aires, and
many Spanish officials and officers fled to Montevideo
for refuge. The garrison of Montevideo furnished
troops and arms for the expedition which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
soon went across the Plate and triumphantly recaptured
Buenos Aires. Late that same year, British
troops from the Cape of Good Hope seized Maldonado
harbour in eastern Uruguay. As soon as re-enforcements
arrived a movement was made against
Montevideo. On the 14th of January, 1807, the
city was besieged by sea and land. The attacking
and defending forces were about equal in number,
although the British regulars were far superior in
discipline and effectiveness to their opponents, half
of whom were militia. A sortie in force was completely
defeated, with a loss of one thousand men,
and after eight days of bombardment the British
effected a breach in the wall and took the town by
assault, the Spaniards losing half their force and the
remainder scattering. A great fleet of merchant
vessels had accompanied the British expedition, and
as soon as the town surrendered their goods were
landed, and the English traders took possession of
the shops almost as completely as the British soldiers
did of the fortifications. Uruguay was opened up
to free trade, the gauchos were soon selling their
hides and horsehair for higher prices than they had
ever received, and buying clothes, tools, and the
comforts and luxuries of civilised life at rates they
had never dreamed possible.</p>

<p>A few months later the English attacked Buenos
Aires, but were overwhelmingly defeated, and the
British general found himself in such an awkward
situation that, in order to obtain permission to withdraw
his army, he had to agree to evacuate Montevideo.
The convention was carried out and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
British soldiers left the Plate forever, but the British
merchants remained behind. Although the English
occupation of the city had lasted so short a time, it
created an unwonted animation in Montevideo by
the establishment of a great number of mercantile
and industrial houses. From this time, Montevideo's
commerce assumed greater proportions and
it became a place of real commercial importance, as
well as a military post. Both city and country had
tasted the delights of commercial freedom, and material
civilisation had received its first great impulse.</p>

<p>Elio, the Spanish military governor of Montevideo,
suspected the loyalty of Liniers, the Frenchman,
who, because he had led in the fighting against
the English, had been created viceroy at Buenos
Aires. Spanish affairs at home were in confusion
and fast becoming worse confounded. The old king
had abdicated in favour of his son; civil war had
broken out on the Peninsula; the new king had
been compelled by Napoleon to resign, and Joseph
Bonaparte was proclaimed monarch of Spain. The
Spanish nation refused to accept Joseph and a revolutionary
government was set up in Seville. Elio,
as a patriotic Spaniard, promptly swore allegiance
to this junta, but the Viceroy and the Buenos Aires
Creoles hesitated as to their course of action. The
Montevidean governor and the Buenos Aires Viceroy
quarrelled; the former accused the latter of unfaithfulness
to Spain and disavowed his authority,
and the latter retaliated by issuing a decree deposing
Elio. On receiving news of this act, which was
strictly legal under Spanish law, the Montevideo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Cabildo met in extraordinary session and appointed
a junta, which was to be dependent solely and
directly upon the authority of the banished legitimate
king and in no way upon Buenos Aires so
long as Liniers remained Viceroy. Thus early did
Montevideo act independently of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Although the sentiment of loyalty was much
stronger in Montevideo than in Buenos Aires, the
English invasion was no sooner over than there became
manifest something of the same profound
division between Creoles and Spaniards. Three
years, however, passed without disturbances; and
even when the news of the overthrow of the new
Spanish Viceroy by the populace of Buenos Aires
on the 25th of May, 1810, reached Montevideo, the
governor was able to prevent any revolutionary
manifestations of sympathy. On the 12th of July
a small part of the garrison rose in a mutiny, which
was easily suppressed. In January, 1811, Elio returned
to Montevideo with a commission as Viceroy
and bringing considerable re-enforcements. He declared
war on Creole revolutionists at Buenos Aires
and imprisoned the Montevideans suspected of Creole
sympathies and revolutionary ideas.</p>

<p>Among those who escaped to Buenos Aires was
one destined to be the founder of Uruguayan
nationality. This was Jos&eacute; Artigas, then captain
of guerrilla cavalry. Although born in Montevideo
he had lived the life of a gaucho from boyhood, and
since 1797 had been a leader of the gaucho bands
who were continually fighting the Rio Grandenses.
He happened to be in Colonia on the occasion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Elio's declaration of war against the Creoles and at
once fled to Buenos Aires. The junta there gave
him a lieutenant-colonel's commission and some
substantial help. The gauchos of the south-eastern
part of Uruguay had meanwhile risen against the
Spanish governor, and within a few weeks Artigas
was back on Uruguayan soil at the head of a considerable
force, while all around him bands of gauchos
under other chiefs were preparing to resist the Spaniards.
His bravery, energy, and good luck in the
field, and his ruthless maintenance of discipline,
gave him an ascendancy over all the others.</p>

<p>In April, 1811, Belgrano, the chief general of
Buenos Aires, arrived with re-enforcements. Shortly
after, a Spanish detachment, which had reached the
western part of Uruguay, was captured, and the
gaucho leaders advanced almost to the walls of
Montevideo. A force of one thousand Spaniards
started out to meet them and, on the 18th of May,
met with complete defeat at the battle of Las
Piedras. For this victory Artigas was promoted by
the Buenos Aires Junta, and became the greatest
military figure on the patriot side. With a considerable
army of gauchos from both banks of the
Uruguay and of patriots from Buenos Aires he
began a siege of Montevideo.</p>

<p>The siege, however, did not last long. The great
expedition sent by the patriots to Bolivia was overwhelmingly
defeated in the battle of Huaqui, and
the Buenos Aires Junta, horribly alarmed for their
own safety, ordered all the troops under their control
to return and help defend that city. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
same time a Portuguese army advanced from Brazil
with the avowed purpose of saving Montevideo from
being lost to Spain, but really to take possession of
Uruguay for King John's own benefit. Artigas was
compelled to retire to the Argentine, and Uruguayan
historians say that on his long retreat to the Uruguay
River he was accompanied by practically the
whole rural population of the country. The semi-nomadic
habits of the gauchos made such a migration
easy, and they quickly found new homes on the
opposite shore in Entre Rios, whence it would be
easy to return as soon as the Portuguese troops
retired.</p>

<p>Considerations of international politics and English
pressure compelled King John to withdraw his
troops from Uruguay in the middle of the year
1812, and the Buenos Aires government immediately
began to assemble an army on the right bank
of the Uruguay. Artigas was still encamped with
his Uruguayan forces in the same neighbourhood,
and although he held an Argentine commission he
was virtually independent. The Argentine army,
under the command of Jos&eacute; Rondeau, who in colonial
days had been captain of guerrillas alongside
Artigas, advanced against Montevideo, and on the
last day of 1812 won the bloody battle of Cerrito, in
sight of the city, and shut the Spaniards up within
its walls. Artigas followed and assisted in the siege,
but he refused to unite his forces with those of
Rondeau until his own claims should be recognised
and his demands complied with. He assumed a
dictatorship and sent delegates to Buenos Aires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
to advocate the formation of a federal republic, of
which Buenos Aires was to be simply one member.
Buenos Aires refused to receive his delegates, and
civil war broke out. Rondeau adhered to the
Buenos Aires interest; and after a year of disputes,
in the beginning of January, 1814, Artigas withdrew
his own followers from Montevideo, leaving
the partisans of Buenos Aires to continue the siege
alone. In May the celebrated Irish admiral, William
Brown, destroyed the Spanish fleet, which had
hitherto dominated the Plate. Montevideo's communications
with both land and sea were shut off,
and the fortress shortly afterwards surrendered to
General Carlos Alvear, the Argentine general who
was then commanding the besieging forces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Artigas had retired to the west, and
the gauchos, not only of western Uruguay, but also
of Entre Rios, Corrientes, the Missions, and Santa
F&eacute;, rallied around his standard. Independent chiefs
in these various provinces had been resisting the
efforts of Buenos Aires to reduce them to obedience.
Artigas was, in a way, recognised as their leader,
but only as the greatest among equals. The conflict
with the Buenos Aires party went on throughout
the year 1814, and the federalists continually
gained ground. In January, 1815, Fructuoso Rivera,
one of the lieutenants of Artigas, defeated an Argentine
force at the battle of Guayabos, and the
Buenos Aires Junta was compelled to withdraw its
troops from Montevideo.</p>

<p>This, however, did not amount to a separation of
Uruguay from the Confederation. It only marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
a triumph of the provinces in their efforts to prevent
Buenos Aires from establishing a centralised government.
Artigas had his friends in Entre Rios, Corrientes,
the Missions, and Santa F&eacute;, and even as far
as Cordoba; and Francia, dictator of Paraguay, was
another of his allies in this struggle against Buenos
Aires. However, he was nothing more than a military
chief, without the capacity or even the desire of
uniting these vast territories under a rational and
stable government.</p>

<p>At the very height of his power he made the fatal
mistake of embroiling himself with Brazil. In 1815
he invaded the territory of the Seven Missions,
which the Rio Grandenses had conquered fourteen
years before. The Portuguese king retaliated by
sending a well-equipped army of several thousand
men, and in October, 1816, the forces of Artigas
were overwhelmed and driven with great slaughter
from the disputed territory. Artigas made stupendous
efforts to retrieve this loss, but the four
thousand men which he assembled to resist the
Portuguese army, which was now advancing upon
Montevideo itself, were defeated and scattered in
January, 1817. The Portuguese occupied Montevideo,
and Artigas and his lieutenants, Rivera, Lavelleja,
and Oribe, each of whom later became a
great figure in the civil wars, retreated to the interior,
where they maintained themselves for two
years. After many defeats, Artigas himself lost
the support of the chiefs of Entre Rios and Santa
F&eacute;. He was finally driven out of Uruguay and
attempted to establish himself in the Argentine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>provinces, only to be completely overwhelmed by
his rivals. On the 23rd of September, 1820, he presented
himself with forty men, all who remained
faithful to him, at the Paraguayan town of Candelaria
on the Paran&aacute;, begging hospitality of Francia.
Francia granted him asylum, and this indomitable
guerrilla chief, who for twenty-five years had kept
the soil of Uruguay and of the Argentine mesopotamia
soaked in blood, spent the rest of his life
peacefully cultivating his garden in the depths of
the Paraguayan forests. He died in 1850 at the age
of eighty-six years; six years later his remains were
brought from Paraguay to Montevideo and interred
in the national pantheon. On the sarcophagus are
engraved these words: "Artigas, Founder of the
Uruguayan Nation."</p>

</div>

<p>Rivera was the last Uruguayan chief to lay down
his arms before the Portuguese. When he surrendered,
early in 1820, most of the other leaders had
already given up and accepted service in the Portuguese
army of occupation. In 1821, a Uruguayan
Congress, selected for this purpose, declared the
country incorporated with the Portuguese dominions
under the name of the Cisplatine Province. For
five years Montevideo and the country remained
quiet under the Portuguese dominion, and Uruguay
peacefully became a province of Brazil when that
country declared her independence. The most celebrated
chiefs of the civil war were officers in the
Brazilian army, and few external signs of dissatisfaction
were apparent. Underneath the surface, however,
fermented a hatred of the foreign rule, and
the proud Creoles only awaited an opportunity to
revolt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE AND CIVIL WAR</h3>


<p>In the beginning of 1825 a group of patriots met in
Buenos Aires and planned an invasion of Uruguayan
territory. Word was sent to different chiefs
in the country districts, and on the night of the 19th
of April thirty-three adventurers, with Lavalleja at
their head, landed on the shore of the river in the
extreme south-western corner of the country. No
sooner had they landed than the country rose; the
troops sent from Montevideo to meet the band of
revolutionists refused to fight, and, deserting the
Brazilian banner, joined their compatriots. The
revolutionists advanced east along the Negro and
the Yi to Durazno, one hundred and thirty miles
north of Montevideo, where they found Rivera, then
general in the Brazilian service. He promptly deserted
and was at once associated with Lavalleja in
the command.</p>

<p>Lavalleja advanced to the south, calling the
population to arms, while the northern detachments
rose in response to Rivera.  Only fifteen days after
the thirty-three had crossed the Uruguay, the flag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of the revolution was floating over the Cerrito Hill
in front of Montevideo, and Brazilian power was
virtually confined to the walls of that city and
Colonia. The military chiefs formally declared
Uruguay separated from Brazil, and proclaimed its
reincorporation with the Argentine. The number
of Brazilians then in Uruguay was small, and infantry
could not be expected to do much fighting
on the plains against gaucho cavalry led by such experienced
guerrilla fighters as Rivera and Lavalleja.
A division of Rio Grandense cavalry, under their
own chiefs, Bento Manoel and Bento Goncalvez,
met the Uruguayans at Sarandi. The two armies
used substantially the same methods, charging into
each other, sword in hand and carbine at shoulder.
The Brazilians were caught in a disadvantageous
position and suffered a complete and bloody overthrow.</p>

<p>The result of this battle was to insure to the
revolutionists the continuation of their complete
dominance in the country. Their cavalry bands
roamed at will up to the very walls of Montevideo.
Buenos Aires received the news with extravagant
demonstrations of joy, and formal notice was given
to Brazil that Uruguay would henceforth be recognised
as an integral part of the Argentine Confederation.
The emperor promptly responded with a
declaration of war. His fleet blockaded Buenos
Aires, while he poured re-enforcements into Montevideo
and sent an army to invade northern Uruguay.
Argentine troops likewise swarmed across the
Uruguay River into the country, and the Brazilians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
could make little progress. On sea they were not
more successful, and by the beginning of 1826 Admiral
Brown was blockading Colonia and menacing
the communications of Montevideo.</p>

<p>In August, 1826, the famous Argentine general,
Carlos Alvear, took command of the patriot forces.
Jealousies and quarrels had meantime broken out
between Lavalleja and Rivera. Alvear took the
former's side and Rivera's partisans revolted. But
the arrival of more re-enforcements for the Brazilians
hushed up for the moment the intestine quarrels of
the Spanish-Americans. Alvear determined to carry
the war into Brazil, and early in January, 1827, succeeded
in passing between the northern and southern
Brazilian armies, and penetrated across the frontier
to the north-east. He had sacked Bag&eacute;, the principal
town of that region, before the Brazilian general,
the Marquis of Barbacena, was able to concentrate
his forces and start in pursuit. Alvear turned north
toward the Missions, but he was in a hostile country
where defeat meant total destruction. Though his
army numbered eight thousand men he had cut himself
off from his base, and an enemy in equal force
was close at his heels. He resolved to turn and give
battle, and on the 20th of February, 1827, his army
met that of Barbacena in the decisive battle of Ituzaingo,
which ended in the defeat of the Brazilians.
Although Barbacena was able to withdraw his army
without material loss, and Alvear retired at once to
Uruguayan soil, the Brazilians were never afterwards
able to undertake a vigorous offensive. The result
of that battle insured that the north bank of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Plate should remain Spanish in blood, language, and
government.</p>

<p>A few days before Ituzaingo, Admiral Brown had
won the great naval fight of Juncal at the mouth of
the river Uruguay, and thenceforth the Brazilian
blockade of Buenos Aires was entirely ineffective.
If it had not been for the civil disturbances in
Argentina that paralysed the Buenos Aires government,
the Brazilians might have been swept out of
Montevideo at the point of the sword, and the
Argentines might have undertaken the conquest of
Rio Grande itself. Though considerable Argentine
forces remained in Uruguay during 1827 and 1828,
they put no vigour into their operations, and on
their part the Brazilians were able to do little more
than hold Montevideo. So hampered was Rivadavia,
the president of Buenos Aires, by revolts, uprisings,
and disorders throughout Argentina that
he thought himself obliged to agree to abandon
Uruguay. Public opinion in Argentina would not
accept the treaty which he made; he was deposed,
and a leader of the opposite party installed in
power.</p>

<p>Rivera, operating on his own account, had undertaken
a campaign against the western Rio
Grande, but so bitter was factional feeling that his
rival, Lavalleja, sent a force to pursue and fight
him, while the new Buenos Aires government was
induced to sign a treaty of peace largely because
Rivera's success against the Brazilians might make
him strong enough to be dangerous. Both Brazil and
Argentina were tired of the tedious, expensive war,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and both governments had preoccupations within
their own territories. Through the intervention of
the British Minister the terms were agreed upon.
Brazil and Argentina both gave up their claims to
Uruguay, the region was erected into an independent
republic, and Brazil and Argentina pledged
themselves to guarantee its independence during
five years.</p>

<p>At that time Argentina was convulsed by the
struggle between the federalists and the unitarians,
and the Uruguayans were also divided into two
camps&mdash;the followers of Lavalleja and those of
Rivera. Neither in Argentina nor in Uruguay were
these divisions parties in any proper sense of that
term. They were military factions, whose ambitious
leaders seem to have been always willing to
sacrifice the interests of the country at large to secure
a partisan advantage. The Argentine troops
who returned home from the war against Brazil
promptly plunged their country into the bloodiest
civil war known in her history, and Uruguay did
not delay in following the example.</p>

<p>The first chief magistrate of independent Uruguay
was Jos&eacute; Rondeau, an Uruguayan who had become
one of the greatest Argentine generals. However,
Lavalleja and Rivera were the real factors in the
situation, and Rondeau's efforts to conciliate both
at the same time failed. The Constituent Assembly,
which soon met and framed a paper constitution,
was controlled by Lavalleja's partisans. Rondeau
was deposed and Lavalleja assumed the reins of
power.  Rivera prepared to march on Montevideo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and dispute the matter by arms, but the representatives
of Argentina and Brazil intervened and a
compromise was effected. Rivera got the best of
the bargain, being given command of the army, and
after the constitution had been declared (July 18,
1830), he became, as a matter of course, the first
president of Uruguay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>CIVIL WAR AND ARGENTINE INTERVENTION</h3>


<p>Except for an expedition against the remnants
of the once formidable Charrua Indians, the
first two years of independence passed in peace.
Since the expulsion of Artigas, the country had
prospered and its population had risen nearly threefold
within twenty-five years, in spite of the bloody
fighting which occurred from 1811 to 1817 and from
1825 to 1828. The settlements had spread far back
from the coast, and many of the principal interior
towns date from this period.</p>

<p>In 1832 the civil wars began again. Lavalleja's
partisans organised a conspiracy, and a certain
Colonel Garzon took advantage of Rivera's absence
from Montevideo to raise a mutiny in the garrison
and to issue a pronunciamento deposing the president.
The latter soon recovered the city, and after
two years of intermittent fighting the Lavalleja
party was overthrown for the moment and Rivera
finished his term in peace.</p>

<p>Manuel Oribe, a chief of the anti-Rivera faction,
succeeded to the presidency by a compromise agree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>ment,
but the breach between the two factions had
really grown wider and their mutual hatred became
irrepressibly bitter. Oribe soon began to persecute
his opponents. Meanwhile, the five years had expired
during which Uruguayan independence had
been guaranteed by the treaty between Argentina
and Brazil. Argentina was free to solicit the reincorporation
of Uruguay into the Confederation.
Rosas, the head of the federalist party, had made
himself master of Buenos Aires, and his authority
was recognised in most of the Argentine provinces,
although the unitarians continued their ineffectual
revolts. The new Uruguayan president sympathised
with the federalists, while his rival, Rivera,
could count on the unitarians. The plan of Rosas
was to establish Oribe firmly in Uruguay and
through his aid to incorporate that country with
Argentina, while the unitarians were desperately
anxious that Rivera should triumph, knowing that
Montevideo would be a base for the organisation of
their own forces for invasions of Buenos Aires and
central Argentina.</p>

<p>Thenceforward for many years Uruguay's history
is inexplicably entwined with the story of the
struggle between the two great Argentine factions.
The little country became the storm-centre of South
American politics and the chief battlefield of the
contending forces. Now for the first time we encounter
references to "blancos" and "colorados,"
which remain to this day the names of Uruguayan
political parties. All the forces of the community
lined up on either side and never have political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
parties fought more determinedly and relentlessly.
The divisions between them entered into all social
and business relations, and even friendly intercourse
between the members of the two factions was almost
impossible. Men have often been more blanco or
colorado than Uruguayan. The old conservative
resident Spanish families were the basis of the blanco,
or Oribe party, while the colorados, or partisans of
Rivera, were the progressive faction. The latter
attracted the Argentine refugees fleeing from the
tyranny of Rosas, and could count upon the
support of resident Europeans and upon the sympathy
of foreign governments. Rosas in Argentina
and the blancos in Uruguay represented the
spirit of exclusivism and opposition to foreign
influences.</p>

<p>After Oribe's accession to power Rivera hastened
to raise a revolt in the western districts. He obtained
help from the unitarians, and his invasion was
accompanied by many Argentine generals who had
distinguished themselves in the wars against Rosas.
The Argentine dictator sent help to Oribe, but for
two years the tide of battle set in favour of the
colorados and unitarians. Rivera had obtained so
decided an advantage by 1838 that Oribe abandoned
Montevideo and embarked for Buenos Aires, followed
by the chiefs of his party. The colorado
chief, now in control of all Uruguay, celebrated a
formal alliance with the province of Corrientes,
then in revolt against Rosas, and war was declared
against the latter. A large Argentine army, accompanied
by many blancos, invaded Uruguay, but was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
decisively defeated at the battle of Cagancha, December
10, 1839.</p>

<p>The interval of unquestioned colorado supremacy
which followed was one of the most flourishing periods
in the history of Uruguay. Large numbers
of the intellectual &eacute;lite of Buenos Aires swarmed
across the river; Montevideo became the centre of
arts and letters of Spanish America; the civil wars
of the last few years had not been severe, and even
during their continuance property had suffered little.
Immigration from England, France, and Italy began
on a large scale, and the population increased at the
rate of four per cent. per annum. In the year 1840
nine hundred ocean-going ships entered the port of
Montevideo, more than three thousand houses were
erected, and twenty-seven great meat-curing establishments
were in active operation. However, Rosas
and the blancos were only awaiting a good opportunity
to attack.</p>

<p>In 1841 Oribe, in command of one of Rosas's
armies, defeated the Argentine unitarians under
General Lavalle, and marched into Entre Rios to
suppress the insurrection in that province. In January,
1842, Rivera took an army of three thousand
men to the rescue of his unitarian allies. He crossed
the river Uruguay and united his forces to those of
General Paz, but after a year's desperate fighting on
Argentine soil he and the unitarian general were
overthrown and their armies completely destroyed
in the battle of Arroya Grande. The way was
open to Montevideo; the colorados and Argentine
exiles shut themselves up in that city, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
so-called nine-years' siege began. Rosas's power
seemed overwhelming, and although Rivera and
other colorado chiefs at the head of scattered bands
managed to make some headway in the outlying
departments, they were finally driven into Brazil,
while the unhappy country was given up to pillage
and slaughter. This <i>guerra grande</i> was the bloodiest,
longest, and most stubborn war ever fought on
Uruguayan soil.</p>

<p>Montevideo seemed doomed to an early surrender
when an opportune intervention by France and
England upset the plans of Rosas. He had embroiled
himself with the ministers of those powers
by refusing to give satisfaction for certain alleged
injuries to foreign merchants and naval officers, and
the dispute became so acrimonious that the European
powers finally resorted to the most drastic
coercive measures. A French, and later a British,
fleet blockaded Buenos Aires and drove Rosas's
vessels from the Plate. Under these circumstances
it was impossible for him to land re-enforcements on
the Uruguayan shore. In 1845 the European navies
forced a passage at the head of the estuary into the
Paran&aacute; and Uruguay, destroying the batteries which
Rosas had erected there and opening up those rivers
to foreign navigation. Thereafter, troops could be
sent from Argentina into Uruguay only by a long
d&eacute;tour to the north.</p>

<p>In spite of this hampering of his military operations,
and the injury which the blockade caused to
the commerce of Buenos Aires, the Argentine dictator
stubbornly refused to yield an inch to foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
pressure. France and England were finally tired
out; they raised the blockade; Rosas regained his
control of the Plate and the early capture of Montevideo
seemed certain. Just at this time, however,
General Urquiza, governor of Entre Rios, and
Rosas's best lieutenant and most successful general,
broke with his chief. Entre Rios became a virtually
independent state, and Rosas's efforts to reduce
it were unavailing. Urquiza's defection again
rendered it impossible properly to reinforce Oribe's
army. The colorados of the interior plucked up
courage and during four years no material progress
was made on either side. A tedious and exhausting
partisan warfare went on in the interior; guerrilla
bands scoured the country in every direction; inhabitants
of the same town were arrayed against
each other, and surprises, treasons, and massacres
were almost daily occurrences. One of the most
successful leaders on the colorado side was the
famous Giuseppe Garibaldi. The future liberator
of Italy had made his d&eacute;but as a revolutionist in the
insurrection which broke out in 1835 in the Brazilian
province of Rio Grande. Later he crossed the
Uruguayan border and fought against Rosas for
several years.</p>

<p>Early in 1851 a grand combination to overthrow
Rosas was made between Entre Rios, Corrientes,
the unitarians, the colorados, and Brazil. The constant
policy of the latter power had been to secure
and maintain the independence of Uruguay, and she
welcomed the opportunity to open up the Paran&aacute;
and Uruguay, on whose headwaters she had great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
territories, inaccessible except along those rivers.
Urquiza naturally became the general-in-chief of the
alliance. On the 18th of July he crossed the Uruguay,
followed by a large army from his own provinces.
A Brazilian army soon joined him and the
colorados flocked to his standard. The Brazilian
fleet came down the coast and controlled the estuary.
An overwhelming force advanced on Montevideo
and the blanco army found itself with a hostile
city and fleet in front, a superior army behind, and
deprived of the hope of receiving help from Buenos
Aires. The officers hastened to make terms with
Urquiza. Whole divisions deserted, and Oribe himself
was obliged to surrender. Many of the soldiers
who had been fighting in the blanco ranks joined
Urquiza, and the latter, after a vain attempt to reconcile
the Uruguayan factions among themselves,
marched his army back through Uruguay and Entre
Rios, crossed the Paran&aacute;, and, descending to Buenos
Aires, defeated Rosas in the great battle of Monte
Caseros.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>COLORADOS AND BLANCOS</h3>


<p>The overthrow of Rosas and Oribe marked the
end of the effort to re-incorporate Uruguay
with the Argentine Confederation. Uruguay was
no longer in peril from foreign aggression, but she
was far from being united. The blancos had apparently
been completely crushed, but their wealth,
prestige, and numbers still made them formidable.
The seeds of division lay thickly in the soil of the
national society and character, sure to spring up and
bear many crops of wars and pronunciamentos.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, the fierce Uruguayan
partisans had had enough of fighting. The colorados
were dominant and the blancos disorganised and
discouraged. It seemed likely that Uruguay would
enjoy a prolonged peace. The wars which lasted
almost continuously from 1843 to 1851 had interrupted
immigration from Europe; unitarians had,
however, crossed in multitudes from Buenos Aires
and many of their families remained after the proclamation
of peace. To this day Montevideo is full
of families descended from Buenos Aires refugees;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the same names constantly recur on both banks of
the Plate, and the social ties uniting the two cities
are intimate. Uruguay's herds of cattle and sheep
had suffered from the depredations of the armed
marauding bands which had scoured the country
districts for nine years, but man's cruel destructiveness
could not injure the magnificent pasturage with
which nature had endowed the nation, and animals
quickly multiplied again by hundreds of thousands.
In 1860 the cattle in Uruguay numbered more than
five millions, the sheep two millions, and the horses
nearly one million. The population increased at the
almost incredible ratio of nine per cent. per annum
after the overthrow of Oribe in 1851 until civil war
again broke out in 1863.</p>

<p>During these years colorado chiefs occupied the
presidency, sometimes succeeding one another,
sometimes by pronunciamento, and sometimes by a
form of election. General Venancio Flores, an able
and ruthless officer, became the principal figure
among the colorados. In 1853 he was a member of
a triumvirate which forced the legal president to
withdraw, and in 1854 he was himself raised to the
presidency, only to be obliged to resign the following
year. As is usual in South America, the dominant
party split into factions, led by ambitious chiefs,
and lost popularity. The blancos, as soon as they got
into power, obtained control of the senate, and their
prestige and wealth soon balanced the military force
of their opponents. In 1860 they finally prevailed,
and their leader, Berro, became constitutional president
of the republic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>The colorados, however, did not propose to submit.
Massed upon the Argentine frontier, they
held themselves ready to fall upon their successful
opponents at the first opportunity. Flores had
been exiled and joined the Argentine army, but in
1863 he obtained aid in Buenos Aires and disembarked
upon the Uruguayan coast with a considerable
force. His partisans rose and he obtained
possession of a large portion of the country and set
up a government of his own. For a year the contest
went on with varying fortunes, and then this
fight between blancos and colorados involved all the
neighbouring nations and brought on the greatest
war which has ever devastated South America and
which resulted in the nearly complete destruction
of the Paraguayan people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<span class="caption">THE SOLIS THEATRE.</span>
</div>

<p>The unitarians, then in power at Buenos Aires,
naturally sympathised with the leader of their old
colorado allies, and were inclined to aid Flores's
attempt to regain control of Montevideo. Brazil
favoured his pretensions even more actively. The
Brazilians of Rio Grande owned most of the land
and cattle just over the Uruguayan border, a third
of all the rural properties in the republic being taxed
to them, and complaints of extortion often came to
the Rio government. The blanco president refused
the satisfaction demanded, and Brazil determined to
enforce the claims of her citizens. Flores was formally
recognised as the legitimate ruler of the country,
and a fleet and army were sent to his assistance.
Lopez, dictator of Paraguay, thought Brazil's intervention
in Uruguay dangerous to the international
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
equilibrium of South America. He protested, and
when the Brazilian government persisted and sent
its army over the border he began war. The
Brazilians advanced to Montevideo and their fleet
came down the coast. The city was blockaded by
sea and besieged by land, while the main body of
the allies advanced against the town of Paysand&ugrave; on
the Uruguay River, where the blancos had assembled
in force. The place was taken by assault and given
up to a horrible pillage, the recollection of which is
still graven in the memory of Uruguayans. The
blanco party never recovered from the slaughter.
Those in Montevideo saved themselves by surrendering
the town without resistance. Flores
entered in triumph and the blanco leaders fled into
exile.</p>

<p>Flores was under obligations to lead a division in
the war against Paraguay, and he absented himself
for that purpose for nearly two years, during which
the country districts were somewhat disturbed. In
1867 he returned and restored order with a strong
hand. This short lease of undisturbed power was
employed in making many important improvements.
Great public edifices were completed, the telegraph
cable was laid to Buenos Aires, the building of railroads
was begun, and a new civil code adopted.
Immigration was resumed on a large scale and the
country felt the economic impulse that was already
transforming the whole Plate valley. Although the
country rapidly prospered under the military administration
of Flores, the feeling of the blancos remained
intensely bitter, and on the 15th of February,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
1868, the colorado president was assassinated in the
streets of Montevideo.</p>

<p>Flores's death was the signal for wholesale executions
and for the outbreak of another long blanco
insurrection. Although the growth of wealth and
population had never been more rapid than at this
very time, the country was not free from civil disturbance
until 1872, when an armistice was signed.
A year later troubles broke out again and the troops
refused to march against the insurgents. To the
bitterness of party feeling and the official corruption
which diminished the revenue and hampered commerce
was added the embarrassment of the financial
difficulties which followed the great panic of 1873.
The public debt had doubled in the ten years between
1860 and 1870 and now reached the enormous
figure of over forty million dollars, nearly $150 for
each inhabitant in the country. One president after
another was unable to maintain himself in the face
of the financial and political difficulties of the situation,
but in 1876 General Lorenzo Latorre, an intelligent
and determined colorado chief, became
dictator. For economy's sake, he reduced the
number of army officers, of whom there were over
twelve hundred for two thousand privates. He
rooted out the worst frauds in the customs service,
and refunded the public debt, compelling the foreign
creditors to accept six instead of twelve per cent.
interest. At the same time he rigidly suppressed
the disorders which had harassed the country since
the murder of Flores. The bands of marauders,
assassins, and bandits, who had exercised their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
nefarious occupations under cover of belonging to
the insurrectionists, were relentlessly pursued and
brought to justice. For the first time in years a
traveller could traverse the country from end to end
without arms. Like Flores, Latorre often used
brute force to secure peace and order, and the
Uruguayans were too turbulent to submit long to
such dictation. Countless conspiracies were formed
which were bloodily suppressed, but public fear and
dislike of Latorre grew continually more menacing.
In 1880, tired out with constant anxieties and
grieved over what he considered the ingratitude of
his countrymen, Latorre resigned his office and went
into exile.</p>

<p>His successor, Dr. Vidal, held the presidency for
only two years, when he, too, was forced to resign.
The next president, Maximo Santos, served his
complete term of four full years, ending in 1886.
Then Vidal managed to get back into power for a
few months and was again replaced by Santos, who,
in turn, was succeeded by Tajes, who governed the
country until 1890. The ten years succeeding the
resignation of Latorre were materially very prosperous.
The sheep industry developed tremendously;
the production of wheat was more than doubled;
immigration ran up to nearly 20,000 a year; the population
of the country reached 700,000, having increased
from 400,000 in twelve years. Immigration
had been so great that the number of the foreign-born
almost equalled the natives, even when including
in the latter those of foreign parentage. In the
mixture of nationalities the foundations have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
laid for a race of unusual vigour and of pure Caucasian
descent.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the old factional feeling largely
died out during the disturbances which succeeded
the murder of Flores. The blancos had suffered
terrible losses in 1864, and the colorados had become
far the more numerous party. During Latorre's
dictatorship the distinctions between the
two were almost lost, and the blanco party, by that
name at least, ceased to be an active factor in politics.
New factions, however, took their place, but
the struggles for place and power lacked the conviction
and ferocity of the old civil wars. The gaucho
and Creole element, although still politically dominant,
was diluted by the infiltration of a more industrially
minded population. The people were not so
exclusively pastoral and had ceased to be so military
in their tastes. The foreign immigrants wanted
peace,&mdash;a chance to sow their wheat and tend their
sheep undisturbed,&mdash;and the gaucho, living on his
horse, feeding on beef alone, and always ready to
ride off to fight by the side of his favourite chief,
ceased in many of the departments to be the dominant
factor. Politics became largely a game played
by the ruling Spanish-American caste and did not
directly interfere with the material interests of the
country, and rarely affected the maintenance of law
and order.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the eighties had been accompanied
by an enormous increase in governmental
expenditures and debt. The economies so painfully
enforced in Latorre's administration were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
abandoned. Nearly as much money was spent in ten
years as had been in the previous fifty years of the
republic's existence. The debt more than doubled,
and the deficit each year equalled fifty per cent.
of the receipts. The Buenos Aires panic of 1890
brought on grave commercial difficulties; real estate
dropped one-half; prices fell, and, as usual, the
people blamed the government. Political disturbances
began with an attempt at a blanco uprising in
Montevideo in 1891. The clergy were active in
fomenting dissatisfaction, but the trouble was suppressed
for the time. Herrera y Obes, elected in
1890, served his term out, but the government was
getting deeper and deeper into the financial mire,
in spite of having cut down the rate of interest on
the public debt fifty per cent. The murmurs of the
public grew constantly more menacing against a
taxation which had become so excessive that it
almost threatened the destruction of industries.</p>

<p>When the election came on in 1894 the outgoing
president found that he had not control of Congress,
the body which elects the president. A deadlock
ensued and the ballots were taken amid confusion
and fears of intimidation. Ellaure, the president's
candidate, dared not accept because of the threatening
attitude of the opposition. Finally, Juan Idiarte
Borda was declared elected, amid outcries and protests
against dictation and terrorism. The new
president pledged himself to reform the finances and
pursue a conciliatory policy toward the different
factions, but he was soon accused of extravagance
and favouritism. The blancos had again become a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
formidable party after twenty years of eclipse, and
they believed that they were being deprived of their
political rights by the colorado president. In 1896
he procured the election of a Congress completely
under his control, and early in 1897, seeing no hope
of a constitutional change, a blanco colonel named
Lamas raised the standard of revolt, assembled a
force in the western provinces, and gained a victory
over the president's soldiers. He marched east
and joined Aparicio Saraiva, a chief belonging to a
family celebrated in the military annals of Brazil,
who had brought a considerable force over the border.
The rebels soon had possession of the eastern
departments and menaced Montevideo, while
Borda borrowed money right and left and armed and
drilled regiment after regiment to prosecute the war
against them. Nevertheless, the rebels maintained
themselves and roamed the country at will. They
would listen to no terms that did not include Borda's
resignation, and it seemed as if the country was
doomed to pass through another long and bloody
civil war.</p>

<p>On August 25, 1897, President Borda was assassinated
in the streets of Montevideo by a respectable
grocer's clerk. The vice-president, Juan L. Cuestas,
succeeded peacefully to the control of the government
in Montevideo, and at once entered into negotiations
with the leaders of the insurrectionists in
the departments. Terms were quickly agreed upon.
Cuestas conceded minority representation and electoral
reform, and in a very short time the rebels
had laid down their arms. The few months of war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
had cost Uruguay dear. Thirteen million dollars had
been spent by the government, the collection of the
revenue had been interrupted, and internal transportation
had been demoralised. Now, however,
industry and commerce resumed their usual course,
and, since President Cuestas's accession to power,
the peace of the country has been undisturbed.
Political manifestations have been confined to disputes
in Congress and the press. They became so
violent that in 1898 the president dissolved the
chambers and declared himself dictator. He reorganised
the army on a basis which insured that
there would be no mutinies, and at the same time
pursued a policy of administrative reform which
has done much to bring order out of the financial
confusion. The obligations of the government have
been religiously performed, and Uruguay's currency
is on a gold basis. In 1899 Cuestas was elected
president according to the forms of the Constitution.
He carried out the pledge he had given the blancos
not to interfere with the elections, and in 1900
they made great gains and elected enough members
to control the Senate. The political situation has,
therefore, been somewhat strained, but there seems
to be no danger that the congressional opposition
will try to interfere with the executive functions of
the president.</p>

<p>This gallant and pugnacious little people will continue
to play a r&ocirc;le in South American affairs out
of all proportion to the size of their country. Uruguay
seems certain to continue to be the political
storm-centre of the Atlantic coast. Climate, soil, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
geographical position insure a rapid increase in population
and wealth, while its political independence
must continue to be an object of constant solicitude
on the part of its gigantic neighbours, Argentina and
Brazil. Montevideo is a formidable trade rival to
Buenos Aires, and must always be, as it has so often
been in the past, the base for any attach at the heart
of the Argentine Republic. To the north nothing
but an artificial boundary separates Uruguay from
Rio Grande do Sul, and the two regions are alike in
everything except language. Should the Portuguese-Americans
again evince those tendencies toward
expansion which distinguished them in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Uruguay
would be the natural point of attack, and if Brazil
should ever divide into its component parts, as it
came so near doing in 1822 and again in 1837, Rio
Grande and Uruguay might find it necessary to
coalesce, or possibly wars might ensue between
them which would change the face of South America.
A not improbable alternative would be the
establishment of a power on the north bank of
the Plate strong enough to hold its own, and which
might play the same r&ocirc;le in the interaction of Spanish
and Portuguese Americans as did Flanders between
the Teutons and Latins in Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>PORTUGAL</h3>


<p>The motherland of Brazil is Portugal. Profound
as were the changes incident to transplanting
a people to a virgin continent; notwithstanding
Spanish dominion and Dutch conquests; large as
were the admixtures of negro, Indian, and alien
blood; in spite of independence and Republicanism;
the language, customs, religion, and laws of Brazil
are to-day substantially like those of Portugal.</p>

<p>The parallel between the United States and Britain
is not closer. Brazil has diverged even less than her
model. Her population may have a larger admixture
of non-Portuguese blood than the North Americans
have of non-British, but politically there was
less opportunity for divergence, for Brazil was kept
under much closer subordination. The discovery of
Brazil coincided with the destruction of popular
liberties in the mother-country. Thereafter, the
Portuguese government was a centralised despotism,
and its hand lay heavy on the Brazilian provinces.
They were forbidden intercourse with the rest of the
world; functionaries of every kind were continually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
imported; the provinces never dreamed of asserting
any right to self-government; from the beginning
the system was centralising and stifling. The North
American colonies of England were left to grow up
by themselves; they were never under a colonial
government properly so called; a revolt followed
the first serious attempt to subject them to a real
colonial r&eacute;gime. But the independence of Brazil
came because liberties were finally granted, not because
they were threatened to be taken away. The
country remained under a tutelage, growing continually
more rigorous, and which ceased only after
the Portuguese monarch had fled from Lisbon and
the colony had become greater than the mother-country.</p>

</div>

<p>It is, therefore, in the little peninsular kingdom,
during the centuries before Cabral caught sight of
the South American coast, that we must look for
the beginnings of Brazil. Rome gave to Portugal
laws, language, religion, and architecture; the forests
of Germany modified her political institutions; the
Saracens gave her the arts, navigation, and material
civilisation. Her happy geographical position near
the Straits of Gibraltar made her the meeting-place
for the Mohammedan and Christian religions&mdash;of
Levantine civilisation with Teutonic barbarism and
liberty. That position also enabled the qualities of
daring and enterprise and the scientific knowledge
acquired in centuries of long conflicts and intercourse
with the Moors to be turned to immediate
advantage when the Renaissance came. Portugal
was the pioneer of Europe in discovery and colonisa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>tion,
though Spain followed close after. Together
they led in making Western European civilisation
dominant beyond seas. The nations who followed
in their track have long since passed them, but
Portugal had once the opportunity of spreading her
influence and institutions over half the planet. In
Brazil she mixed success with the failure that was
her fate elsewhere. Brazil is to-day the nation
which has inherited Roman civilisation in the least
modified form, and is the country where the genuine
Latin spirit has the best opportunity for growth and
survival.</p>

<p>The study of Portugal takes on a new dignity and
importance when we reflect that she has given language,
institutions, and laws to half of South America
and to a population that already outnumbers her
own four to one. She is entitled to the interest of
the world if only because she has placed her indelible
imprint on a region which is as large as Europe
and as fertile as Java, and which is destined within
the next two centuries to support the largest population
of any of the great political divisions of the
globe.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, the coalescence of a fragment
of the kingdom of Leon with the Moorish
territory near the mouth of the Tagus originated
Portugal as a separate country. The race was very
mixed. Its principal elements were the Leonese
and the Mosarabes&mdash;the latter being the Christians
of Moorish Portugal left undisturbed from Visigothic
times by their tolerant Mohammedan conquerors.
Each of these elements was, in its turn, of mixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
origin. To the original Iberian population, which
had occupied the Peninsula two thousand years before
the Christian era, had been successively added
Phenicians, Greeks, Celts, Ligurians, Carthaginians,
Latins,&mdash;and in Roman times,&mdash;officials, soldiers,
and slaves from all over the empire, including many
Jews. The long Roman dominion welded all these
together into a homogeneous mass. Later, the Visigothic
conquest added a large Teutonic contingent,
which is especially evident in northern and Leonese
Portugal. Still later, the Saracens intermarried in
considerable numbers with the Mosarabes of southern
Portugal. After the formation of the modern
kingdom, another element was added in the French,
Proven&ccedil;als, Flemings, and English who came in
large numbers to aid in the final expulsion of the
Moors. By the end of the fourteenth century, the
Portuguese had become a distinct nation. Racial
and religious tolerance were more advanced than
in the rest of Europe; self-governing municipalities
covered the greatest part of the country, each privileged
within a definite territory. The nobles, prelates,
and monastic and military orders were still
privileged, and their property was not subject to
tribute, but their power was not predominant. The
king was chief of the army and the proprietor of a
very considerable proportion of the land, but he was
under constant pressure to grant it to the religious
orders and to the nobles. The people were everywhere
heavily taxed&mdash;in the municipalities and
Crown lands by the king, and on the estates of the
privileged orders for the benefit of their great pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>prietors.
The nobles were under no enforceable
obligation to perform military service. A great general
deliberative and representative assembly&mdash;the
Cortes&mdash;had come into being when the monarchy
was founded. It included representatives of the
municipalities as well as nobles and clergy, and its
importance and vitality are shown by the fact that
from 1250 to 1376 it met twenty-five times. By the
latter date, jurisprudence had become generalised
and its administration had fallen into the hands of
the Crown. The nation had developed out of local
and class privilege a reasonably consistent and uniform
administration. The municipalities were the
basis of the governmental structure, and a rude but
effective local self-government existed through their
instrumentality. The norm for the centralisation
and organisation had not been, as in nearly all the
rest of Europe, the feudal system, but the surviving
fragments of the Roman structure. To the municipalities
was largely due the astonishing vigour shown
by the Portuguese people in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The norm even survived the destruction
of liberty, and its influence can be seen in
every step of the subsequent development of Portugal
and also of Brazil.</p>

<p>Portugal's heroic era began near the close of
the fourteenth century. The great King John I.,
founder of the dynasty of Aviz, secured Portugal for
ever from absorption by Spain when he won the battle
of Aljubarrota in 1385. This was the signal for
a rapid transformation of the character and policies
of the Portuguese people. The thirst for war and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
adventure grew. The old Portugal&mdash;laborious, agricultural,
home-loving, conservative&mdash;was replaced
by a new Portugal&mdash;adventurous, seafaring, eager,
romantic, longing for conquest, glory, and wealth,
its eyes straining over the sea, the embodiment of
the spirit of the Renaissance on its material side.
The meeting of the Levant and the Baltic, the East
and the West, Mohammedans and Christianity, the
arts and knowledge of the old races with the energy
of the new, had at last produced its perfect work.
In 1415 an army was sent into Africa, and Ceuta
was conquered; and there began that marvellous
series of voyages which not only transformed Portugal
into an empire, but gave a new world to Europe
and revolutionised the planet. Modern scientific
navigation began with the sailors instructed in the
school which was set up at Sagres by Prince Henry,
King John's son. Until then, European nautical
knowledge had been very meagre. The compass
served only to indicate direction, not distance or
position, and did not suffice for the systematic navigation
of the open Atlantic. The Portuguese first
made that possible by using astronomical observations
and inventing the quadrant and the astrolabe.</p>

<p>This knowledge, once acquired, was promptly applied
to the work of navigation. Madeira was discovered
in 1418; the Canaries in 1427; the Azores
in 1432. The first and last were colonised and
rapidly became populous. To the West the explorers
pushed no farther for the present, but to the
south they reached Cape Blanco in 1441, Senegambia
and Cape Verde in 1445, and the Cape Verde Islands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
in 1460. In 1469, they turned into the Gulf of
Guinea, and in 1471 were the first Europeans to
cross the Equator. Their search, at first random,
now became definite. They believed it was only
necessary to keep on and they would round the
southern extremity of Africa and reach Abyssinia
and India by sea, a hope which became a certainty
in 1487, when Bartholomew Diaz finally reached the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a political revolution had been going
on. The strong kings of the line of Aviz had won
for the Crown a moral preponderance over the nobility
and clergy. The latter resisted the royal
encroachments, but the municipalities joined the
monarchs in the struggle against them. The king
who established centralised despotism&mdash;the Richelieu
of Portugal&mdash;was John II., the third of the Aviz
dynasty, and who reigned from 1481 to 1495. Under
his rule, the whole military power was concentrated
in the Crown; the nobility became a class living at
Court; the king was the fountain of all honour and
advancement; local officers were replaced by officials
appointed by and responsible to the central government;
piece by piece the independent functions of
the municipalities were taken away.</p>

<p>Concentration of power in the hands of monarch
and bureaucracy produced its inevitable effect. A
short period of marvellous brilliancy in arms, statecraft,
literature, and the arts was followed by sudden
decay. The self-governing municipalities had
nurtured a multitude of men whom small power and
responsibility fitted for great things. The nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
turned eagerly to the work of exploration and conquest
and prosecuted it efficiently.</p>

<p>Such a people would undertake conquest for their
king, rather than colonisation on their own account;
they would emigrate under military leadership and
forms; their colonies would tolerate a close control
by the mother country; they would seek to convert
the aborigines and reduce them to slavery; private
initiative would be stifled and overshadowed by
that of the government; large proprietorship would
be the rule; the colonies would be burdened with
functionaries sent in successive swarms from home;
taxation would be excessive; the best talent would
go into the bureau and not concern itself with industrial
matters; invention and originality would be
discouraged; agriculture would not be diversified,
nor manufactures thrive. To this day a few staple
crops predominate in Brazil; small landownership
is the exception, and the people show little aptitude
for change when unfavourable circumstances make
their crops unprofitable. Brazilian Creoles have
little taste for manual pursuits, and not much more
for commerce. Non-Portuguese immigration has
supplied most of the labour; foreigners have always
conducted most of the trade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>On the 9th of March, 1500, Pedro Alvarez Cabral,
a Portuguese nobleman of illustrious birth,
but not yet distinguished by any notable feats in
war or seamanship, sailed from Lisbon for the East
Indies. This expedition was sent out to continue
the work begun by Vasco da Gama in the first all-sea
voyage to India. It was an advance-guard for
the larger armament that two years later founded
the Portuguese empire on the coasts of India.
Vasco da Gama himself wrote Cabral's sailing orders.
The latter was instructed, after passing the Cape
Verde Islands in 14&deg; North, to sail directly south,
as long as the wind was favourable. If forced to
change his course, he was ordered to keep on the
starboard tack, even though it led him south-west.
When he reached the latitude of the Cape of Good
Hope&mdash;34&deg; South&mdash;he was to bear away to the east.</p>

<p>These sailing instructions have been the subject
of much discussion. Many believe their sole purpose
was to enable Cabral to avoid the Guinea calms,
so annoying to sailing ships near the African coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Others contend that Da Gama had seen signs of land
to the west on his own voyage, and that its discovery
was a real, though secondary, object of the expedition.
In any event the Brazilian coast is too near
the natural route around Africa to have escaped
encounter, and would infallibly have shortly been
seen by some one else.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 787px;">
<img src="images/illus-316.jpg" width="787" height="600" alt="OLD TOWER AT LISBON WHENCE THE FLEET SAILED." title="" />
<span class="caption">OLD TOWER AT LISBON WHENCE THE FLEET SAILED.</span>
</div>

<p>Forty-two days after leaving Lisbon, Cabral's
fleet saw unmistakable signs of land, being then in
latitude 17 degrees south and longitude 36 degrees
west. From the Cape Verde Islands, just off the
western point of Africa, he had made 2300 miles,
and had come 500 miles to the west. The next day
a mountain was sighted, which he called Paschoal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
because it was Easter week. This mountain is in
the southern part of the state of Bahia, about four
hundred miles north-east of Rio, and on a coast that
to this day is sparsely inhabited and rarely visited.
The following day the whole fleet came to an anchor
a mile and a half from the shore, and just north of
the dangerous Abrolhos reefs. This was the 23rd
of April, Old Style, which corresponds with the 3rd
of May in the Gregorian calendar. The date is a
national holiday in Brazil, and the anniversary for
the annual convening of Congress.</p>

<p>Because no quadrupeds or large rivers were seen,
Cabral thought he had discovered an island and
named it the "Island of the True Cross." The
name has not survived except in poetry. He
stopped ten days on the coast, took formal possession,
and sent expeditions on shore which entered
into communication with the Indians, who were seen
in considerable numbers. It is characteristic that
the first question asked of the Indians was if they
knew what gold and silver were. They were peaceable
and friendly, and the old chronicle describes
them as of a dark reddish complexion with good
features, and muscular, well-shaped bodies. They
wore no clothes, their lower lips and cheeks were
perforated to carry great ornaments of white bone,
and their hair was elaborately dressed and adorned
with feathers.</p>

<p>These were fair specimens of the Tupi-Guaranies,
the largest of the four great families into which the
Brazilian aborigines have been classified. The others
are the Caribs, the Arawaks, and the Botacudos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
There are also traces of tribes who inhabited the
country remote centuries ago. In caves in Minas
Geraes skeletons have been found remarkably like
those of the earliest Europeans. The theory is that
these Indians came from Europe by land in that remote
geological epoch when Scandinavia was joined
to Greenland. Later came Mongoloids, probably
by way of the Behring Strait, who appear largely to
have exterminated their European predecessors, and
to have been the ancestors of the modern Indians.</p>

<p>When America was discovered, the four great families
were spread in scattering and widely differing
tribes over the whole of Brazil and the adjacent
countries. Their state of culture varied from that
of the most squalid tribes of Botacudos, who had
not even reached the Stone Age, lived in brush
shelters, slept in the ashes of their fires, practised
promiscuous marriage, and had no idea of religion
except a fear of malignant spirits; up to Arawaks,
who were cleanly, had a well-defined tribal organisation,
and built marvellous canoes, or Tupis, who
cultivated the soil, built fair houses, used rude machinery
for making mandioc flour, spun cotton, wove
cloth, and were good potters. But the civilisation
of the best of them was stationary. No Brazilian
tribe ever got beyond the condition where the
struggle to obtain food was its sole preoccupation.
No civilisation like that of Mexico, Peru, or Yucatan
ever existed. Disaggregation, failure, and obliteration
were the rule. Organically unfitted to cope
with their surroundings they never devised a method
of getting a good and permanent food-supply.  De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>fective
nutrition sapped their powers to resist strains.
Their muscular appearance was not accompanied by
corresponding endurance. Their European taskmasters
could never understand why they died from
the effects of exertion to which a white man would
easily have been equal. The vast majority had no
regular agriculture and lived on the spontaneous
products of the forests and the streams. Land game
is not abundant in the tropics, and they had developed
only few good food plants. What they did
procure was spoiled by bad preparation. Such a
people had no chance of successfully resisting the
Portuguese invaders, and their only hope of survival
was in contact and admixture with the more
vigorous white and black races.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-319.jpg" width="800" height="491" alt="A TUPI VILLAGE." title="" />
<span class="caption">A TUPI VILLAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>The Tupi-Guaranies occupied one-fourth of Brazil,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
all of Paraguay and Uruguay, and much of Bolivia
and the Argentine, and it is probable that the original
seats of this family were in the central table-lands or
in Paraguay. All Tupi Indians spoke dialects of one
language, which the Jesuit missionaries soon reduced
to grammatical and literary form, and which became
a <i>lingua franca</i> that was understood from the Plate
to the Amazon. Back of the coast Tupis were the
Botacudos, the most degraded and intractable of
Brazilian savages, remnants of whom still survive in
their original seats in Espirito Santo, Minas, and S&atilde;o
Paulo. The Caribs, with whom students of the history
of the Caribbean Sea are familiar, originated in
the plains of Goyaz and Matto Grosso and emigrated
as far north as the Antilles. The Arawaks were
most numerous in Guiana and on the Lower Amazon,
but were also spread over central Brazil.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Indians did not survive the white
man's coming to as large an extent as in Spanish-America.
The pure Indian is found in Brazil only
in regions where the white man has not thought it
worth while to take possession, and the proportion
of Indian blood is much smaller than in surrounding
countries. In many localities, evidences of Indian
descent are so rare as to be remarkable.</p>

<p>Cabral's voyage was the real discovery of Brazil,
if we consider historical and political consequences.
It was the first reported to Europe; and the Portuguese
Crown immediately made formal claim to the
territory. But, as a matter of fact, land which to-day
is a part of Brazilian territory had been seen by
Europeans before Cabral landed. In January, 1500,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Vincente Yanez Pinzon, who had commanded the
<i>Ni&ntilde;a</i> on the first voyage of Columbus, saw land in
the neigbourhood of Cape St. Roque. Bound westward,
he bore away to the west and north, following
the prevailing winds and currents as far as the
Orange Cape, the present extreme northern limits
of Brazil. He was, therefore, the discoverer of the
great estuary which forms the mouth of the Amazon.
He named it the "Fresh-Water Sea," because the
great river freshens the open ocean far out of sight
of land, but he did not ascend, nor even see, the
river proper. It is also claimed on good evidence
that, six months before Pinzon, another Spanish
navigator, Alonso de Ojeda, accompanied by Amerigo
Vespucci, had made the South American coast
not far from Cape St. Roque; and that a month
later still another, Diego de Lepe, did the same.</p>

<p>None of these Spanish voyages produced any results.
They were not reported until after the news
of Cabral's discovery had been solemnly promulgated
to the Courts of Europe, and were soon forgotten.
The honour of making Brazil known to
Europe belongs to Cabral just as certainly as that
of discovering America does to Columbus. The
Spanish voyages are interesting to antiquarians,
but neither they nor the Norwegian voyages of the
eleventh century were followed up, or produced any
permanent results.</p>

<p>The news reached Portugal in the fall of 1500,
and no time was lost in sending out a small fleet to
ascertain definitely the extent, value, and resources
of the region.  The Portuguese hoped to find a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
wealthy and civilised population like that of India&mdash;rich
and unwarlike nations, such as the Spaniards
did encounter a few years later in Peru and Mexico.
The exploring expedition was under the command
of Amerigo Vespucci, the greatest technical navigator
of the age. He shaped his course so as to
keep to the windward and south of the redoubtable
promontory of St. Roque, which the clumsy ships
of that day could not weather in the teeth of the
trade-winds and the equatorial current, and, turning
to the south, made a systematic examination of
the coast nearly as far as the river Plate, employing
five months in the task. In naming the rivers,
capes and harbours, he saved his inventive faculty
and gratified the popular religious sentiment by
calling each one by the name of the saint on whose
anniversary it was reached. Most of these names
have survived. For example, the S&atilde;o Francisco,
the largest river between the Amazon and the Plate,
is so called because Vespucci reached it on October
1, 1501, which date is sacred to St. Francis in the
Roman calendar. Rio de Janeiro is so named because
he saw the great bay, whose entrance is narrower
than many rivers, on New Year's Day, 1501.
He coasted along for two thousand miles, looking
eagerly for gold, silver, spices, and civilised inhabitants.
He was disappointed. The only thing found
which seemed to have an immediate market value
was brazil-wood&mdash;a dye-wood that had been used in
Europe for centuries and was in great demand. Its
colour was a bright red&mdash;hence its name, which
means "wood the colour of fire."  It was found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
such abundance that the world's supply has since
been drawn from this coast, and among sailors and
merchants the country soon became known as "the
Country of Brazil-wood." The name almost immediately
supplanted "Santa Cruz." Vespucci saw
that the country was fertile and the climate pleasant.
This was not enough to satisfy his greedy employers.
A government whose coffers were beginning to overflow
with the profits of the Indian spice-trade and
the African mines was not inclined to pay much
attention to a region without the precious metals,
and inhabited only by naked savages. The reports
of the abundance of brazil-wood, however, induced
private adventurers to go and cut that valuable
commodity. The government declared it a Portuguese
monopoly, but the high price of the article
made the trade so enormously profitable, that ships
of other nationalities, especially French, could not
be excluded.</p>

<p>The coast soon became well known, but the Portuguese
government did not extend its explorations
to the south. It was left to the Spaniards to find
the passage into the Pacific Ocean and to explore
the tributaries of the Plate. The southern extension
of the continent became and remains Spanish.
No exact records exist of the earliest Portuguese
explorations of the northern coast from Cape St.
Roque to the mouth of the Amazon. We only
know that some Portuguese ships navigated those
waters and that Spain never seriously disputed
Portugal's title to that region.</p>

<p>For thirty years Brazil remained unsettled, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the fleets going to the East Indies often stopped
in its admirable harbours to refit and take water.
Private adventurers came for brazil-wood and the
French poached more and more frequently. Soon
the latter began to establish little factories to which
they returned year after year, and got on good terms
with the aborigines. It became evident that Portugal
must establish fortified, self-sustaining posts if
she expected to retain the territory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>


<p>Cabral's discovery bequeathed to the Portuguese
race one of the largest, most productive,
and valuable political divisions of the globe.
The area is 3,150,000 square miles&mdash;larger than the
United States without Alaska, and surpassed only
by the British, Russian, Chinese, and American empires.
From north to south it extends 2600 miles,
and east and west 2700. Lying across the equator
and traversed by no very high mountain ranges, its
climate is more uniform than any other equally large
inhabited region, but its extent is so immense that
there are very considerable variations.</p>

<p>Compact in form, with a continuous seacoast,
unsurpassable harbours, and a great extension of
navigable rivers, water communication between the
different parts is easy and the danger of dismemberment
by external attack a minimum. Occupying
the central portion of South America it touches all
the other countries of the continent except Chile,
uniting them geographically, and to a large extent
controlling land communication among them.  It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
is nearer Europe and Africa than any other South
American country, and is also on the direct route
between the North Atlantic and both coasts of
South America. Situated in latitudes where evaporation
and precipitation are largest, where the trade-winds
unfailingly bring moisture from the Atlantic,
and on the eastern and windward slope of the narrowest
of the continents, Brazil has the steadiest
and most uniformly distributed rainfall of any large
part of the globe.</p>

<p>The exuberance of life in Brazil must be seen to
be realised. The early voyagers related the wonder
and admiration which they felt. Amerigo Vespucci
said that if Paradise did exist on this planet it could
not be far from the Brazilian coast. Agassiz believed
that the future centre of the civilisation of
the world would be in the Amazon valley. The
plants useful for food, and in industry, commerce,
and medicine, are innumerable. Nowhere except in
Ceylon does the palm flourish so. There are more
plants indigenous to Brazil than to any other country,
and many species, like coffee, transplanted there
have doubled in productiveness. Indian corn and
mandioc were already cultivated by the Indians when
Cabral landed, and both upland and lowland rice
grew wild. The soil lends itself kindly to any kind
of culture, and in most cases two crops may be
reaped annually. In a word the subsoil, the soil,
the atmosphere, the forests, and the waters of Brazil
are teeming with life and full of potential wealth&mdash;too
much so, perhaps, for the most wholesome development
of the human race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>The most extensive and the least-developed part
of Brazil is the Amazon valley. The Brazilian portion
of the Amazon basin comprises forty-five per
cent. of the whole territory of the republic. The
northern and south-eastern borders slope up to the
surrounding mountains, but the rest is an early level
plain, little elevated above the sea. The plains are
covered with dense forests, much of the country
is frequently flooded, and communication is only
possible by the streams. In their neighbourhood
the climate is in many localities unhealthful, and
is everywhere tropical and rainy. Back from the
rivers is an unexplored and unknown wilderness.
The Amazon with its tributaries forms the greatest
of all navigable fluvial systems. Ten thousand seven
hundred miles are already known to be suitable for
navigation by steamboats, and four thousand eight
hundred more for smaller boats.</p>

<p>It is in the narrow coast-plain on the Atlantic, and
in the high regions lying to the east and south of
the great central depression, that the Brazilian people
live.</p>

<p>The main orographical feature of non-Amazonian
Brazil is the great mountain system which extends
uninterruptedly from the northern coast through
the whole country. This continental uplift corresponds
to the Andes on the west coast, just as the
Apalachians do to the Rockies in North America.
Its relative importance is many times greater on account
of its great width, and because a broad plateau
nearly connects it with the Andes between the
headwaters of the Amazon and Plate river systems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
The joint result is that two-thirds of Brazil is high
enough to have a moderate and healthful climate,
but the cataracts in the rivers and the steep escarpments
of the mountains make it difficult of access.</p>

<p>The promontory of South America which reaches
out to the north-east, looking in a direct line to the
western extremity of Africa, is a region of gentle
slopes, of wide, sparsely wooded plateaux, and of
brush-covered hills. At long intervals, the interior
is subject to severe drouths. The soil is fertile as a
rule and the rainfall generally sufficient for cereal
crops. Nearing the sea precipitation increases, and
cotton and sugar thrive. The mountain ranges
rarely exceed three thousand feet in height, and lie
far back from the coast, from which the country
slopes up gradually. This region was the first in
Brazil to contain a large population, and the Dutch
fought hard for it during the seventeenth century.
In its area of 430,000 square miles seven of the
Brazilian states are included&mdash;Maranh&atilde;o, Piauhy,
Cear&aacute;, Rio Grande do Norte, Parahyba, Pernambuco,
and Alagoas. The promontory of St. Roque, where
the coast turns from an east-and-west direction to
a north-and-south, marks a commercial division.
Sailing vessels found it difficult to round this cape
from the north, and consequently the commercial relations
of Maranh&atilde;o, Piauhy, and Cear&aacute; have been
rather with the Amazon than southern Brazil.
South of St. Roque the region is most easily accessible
from Europe and is on the direct line of communication
between both sides of the North Atlantic
and the coasts to the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The region drained by the Tocantins and Araguaya
very nearly corresponds with the state of
Goyaz. It is the western slope of the Brazilian
Cordillera, and differs radically from the Amazonian
plain, which it adjoins. As one ascends the Tocantins
and Araguaya from their mouths in the Amazon
estuary the altitude rapidly rises and navigation is
quickly interrupted by cataracts. In the south the
level rises to over four thousand feet, and the climate
shows a considerable range of temperature, with the
thermometer sometimes falling below freezing in the
higher mountains. Though the area is 350,000 square
miles, the population hardly reaches a quarter of a
million, and has not been increasing rapidly since the
exhaustion of the alluvial gold deposits. Roughly
speaking, it may be described as a region well adapted
to cattle and agriculture, and composed of high, open,
rolling plateaux traversed by low mountain ranges
and well-wooded river valleys.</p>

<p>The next natural division comprises the oval depression
lying between the great central watershed
and the high range which runs straight north from
Rio within a few hundred miles of the coast. This
is the S&atilde;o Francisco valley. Politically and commercially
connected is the adjacent coast-plain.
Valley and plain are divided into the four states of
Minas, Bahia, Sergipe, and Espirito Santo, with
430,000 square miles and 6,000,000 inhabitants. In
the coast-plain the rainfall is greater than farther
north, and the soil is very fertile, producing not
only cotton, sugar, and tobacco, but coffee, maize,
and mandioc. The slopes are more abrupt and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
mountains begin closer to the sea. The interior is
a great plateau traversed by high mountain ranges
and the tributaries of the S&atilde;o Francisco River.
Most of this plateau is included in the great state of
Minas, the most populous member of the Brazilian
union, which is agriculturally self-sufficing, and one
of the great mineral regions of the world. The rainfall
is abundant, the climate is healthful and bracing,
the birth-rate is large, and the region is admirably
adapted to the white races. Its general character is
a rolling plateau, three to four thousand feet above
the ocean, forming extensive, treeless plains, which
are interspersed with wooded mountain chains, river
valleys, and extensive tracts of brush-land. The
European who visits the S&atilde;o Francisco valley is
astonished to find a country where the climate is
temperate and the soil fitted to the production of all
sorts of food crops including the cereals, and where,
nevertheless, proximity to the equator makes practicable
a multiplicity of crops in a single year. The
coast-plain, which forms the greatest part of Bahia,
Sergipe, and Espirito Santo, is fertile, but the
climate is enervating to Europeans, and the proportion
of black blood there is the largest in Brazil.</p>

<p>About the twentieth degree the mountains approach
close to the coast, and from Victoria south
to the thirtieth degree the Atlantic border of Brazil
is steep and mountainous, often rising directly from
the sea to a height of two thousand to six thousand
feet. It is a coast of splendid harbours and magnificent
scenery. The drainage is mostly inland into
the Plate system, and water falling within a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
miles of the ocean flows 2500 miles before reaching
the sea.</p>

<p>To this rule there is but one important exception&mdash;the
Parahyba River, the basin of which is practically
coterminous with the state of Rio de Janeiro
and the federal district. This state is commercially
and politically very important, although its
area is small. The surface is very mountainous and
the soil mostly inferior to that of the divisions to
the north and south. However, it is still an immense
producer of coffee and sugar. Its geographical situation
and great harbour have made it the most thickly
settled part of the country. The rainfall is very
large, especially on the mountains nearest the sea,
which are covered with magnificent forests. The
coast-plain is warm though not unhealthful, save in
the vicinity of the infected city of Rio, and in the
higher regions the climate is delightful and in temperature
almost European. The northern boundary
is the Mantiqueira range which divides the Parahyba
basin from the valleys of the Paran&aacute; and S&atilde;o Francisco.
This range is the highest in Brazil, and its
culminating peak&mdash;Itatiaya&mdash;is ten thousand feet
high, though it is only seventy miles from the sea.
Slightly lower ranges lie between the Mantiqueira
and the ocean, and of these the highest is Pedro
d'Assu&mdash;7365 feet&mdash;which overlooks Rio harbour,
only twenty miles away.</p>

<p>The Brazilian portion of the great Paran&aacute; valley
presents a remarkable uniformity of general characteristics.
Bordering the sea is a range of mountains,
or rather the abrupt escarpment of the plateau,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
some three thousand feet high. From its summit
the surface slopes gently to the west, draining into
the Paran&aacute; by a hundred streams, many of which
are navigable in their middle courses. This great
plateau&mdash;with its area of about 250,000 square miles&mdash;is
mostly treeless toward the north, but in the
south is covered with pine forests. It lies in the temperate
zone and snow sometimes falls on the higher
peaks and <i>chapadas</i> of S&atilde;o Paulo. The soil is remarkably
fertile, and this is the coffee region <i>par
excellence</i> of the world. A coffee tree in S&atilde;o Paulo
produces two to four times as much as in other parts
of the globe. Food crops grow well, and the country
might be economically independent of the rest
of the world. The contour of the country is favourable
to railroad-building and the region is easily
penetrable. From their settlements on the seaward
border of this plateau the Paulistas of the seventeenth
century roamed over the whole interior of
South America, enslaving the Indians and driving
out the Spanish Jesuits. The rainfall diminishes
toward the interior, and there is an ill-defined limit
where it ceases to be sufficient for coffee. The coffee
district is also limited by the lowering of average
temperature with increasing latitude. The three
states of S&atilde;o Paulo, Paran&aacute;, and Santa Catharina
contain most of the region under description, but
south-western Minas and extreme southern Goyaz
also belong to it.</p>

<p>The great plateau gradually dies away to the
south ending with a low escarpment across the state
of Rio Grand do Sul. Physically and geographic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>ally,
this State is different from the rest of Brazil.
Most of its area is drained by the Uruguay River,
and its natural relations and affinities are with the
republic of that name. Rio Grande's ninety-five
thousand square miles contain over a million inhabitants,
and the open, rolling plains, nowhere much
elevated above the sea, are excellently adapted to
cattle. The northern portion is higher, more broken,
and more wooded than the southern, and agriculture
has made greater progress. The climate is distinctly
that of the temperate zone&mdash;hot in summer, cold in
winter, and subject to sudden variations on account
of the winds which sweep up from the vast Argentine
pampas. The inhabitants are big, vigorous,
and hardy, and great riders. All the products of
the temperate zone, including the cereals, flourish,
and this part of Brazil seems destined to great things
in the near future.</p>

<p>From Bolivia around to Uruguay sweeps in a
great semicircle, convex to the north, a plateau that
nearly unites the Andes with the Eastern Cordillera,
and forms the watershed between the Amazon and
the Plate. Its eastern horn has already been described
as forming the states of S&atilde;o Paulo, Paran&aacute;,
and Santa Catharina; its western and central portions
form the great interior state of Matto Grosso.
Here the headwaters of the Madeira, Tapajos, and
Xingu, tributaries of the Amazon, intertwine with
those of the Paraguay and Paran&aacute;. The narrow
depression which the Upper Paraguay forms across
it is the only portion that has yet been described.
The rest of the 410,000 square miles of Matto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Grosso is abandoned to Indians and wild beasts.
Only enough is known of these solitudes to prove
that in the centre of the continent exists a well-watered,
fertile, and healthful region, capable of
sustaining an immense population, but which is shut
off from development by lack of means of communication.
The northwestern part could be reached
from the Amazon if the Falls of the Madeira could
be overcome, a route which would also open up a
great and now inaccessible portion of Bolivia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>EARLY COLONISATION</h3>


<p>The permanent settlement of Brazil was begun
by deserters and mutineers set on shore from
ships on their way to India or to cut brazil-wood.
In 1509 a certain Diego Alvarez, nicknamed by the
Indians "Caramuru," or "man of lightning," landed
at Bahia and escaped being eaten by frightening the
Indians with his musket. He married a chief's
daughter, and when a real colony was established
years later he and his numerous half-breed descendants
proved of great use to his compatriots. Two
years later John Ramalho did much the same near
Santos, hundreds of miles to the south. The story
of the last of the three authentic <i>degradados</i> is even
more romantic. His name was Aleixo Garcia, and
with three companions he landed about 1526 in
the present state of Santa Catharina. Collecting
an army of Indians he led them on a conquering
and gold-hunting expedition over the coast-range,
across the great plateau, into the valley of the Paraguay,
and even penetrated ten years before Pizarro
into territory tributary to the Incas of Peru. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
finally perished in the centre of the continent, but
when, years afterwards, the Spaniards penetrated
the valley of the Paran&aacute; they found that the Indians
already knew of white men and firearms.</p>

<p>As early as 1516 the Portuguese government offered
to give farming utensils free to settlers in Brazil,
and it is probable that shortly afterwards some
sugar was planted. The first serious and official
effort to cultivate sugar was made in 1526. Christov&atilde;o
Jaques founded a factory on the island of Itamarica,
a few miles north of Pernambuco. It was
shortly destroyed by the French brazil-wood hunters,
and the settlers fled to the site of Pernambuco
and renewed the effort pending the arrival of re-enforcements.
Seekers of brazil-wood hailing from
Honfleur and Dieppe were swarming along the coast.
The value of the region for sugar raising began to
be appreciated. When the news came of the failure
of the Spanish expedition which Cabot had led to
the Plate, the Portuguese government determined
to fit out a considerable expedition, composed of
colonists and families as well as soldiers and adventurers.
Seduced by the cry, "We are going to the
Silver River," four hundred persons enlisted. The
five vessels were commanded by Martim Affonso da
Souza, a great general and navigator, who had already
proved his capacity and who later went to
the very top in the East Indian wars. He was instructed
to expel all intruders and establish a permanent
fortified colony. Early in 1531 he reached
the coast near Pernambuco, captured three French
ships laden with brazil-wood, and sent two caravels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
north to explore the coast beyond Cape St. Roque,
while he himself sailed south with the idea of founding
a colony on the Plate. But after passing Santa
Catharina he was unfortunate in losing his largest
ship with most of his provisions, and deemed it safer
to return toward the north. At S&atilde;o Vicente, now
a little town near the great coffee port of Santos, he
dropped anchor, and there, January, 1532, founded
the first Portuguese colony in Brazil. Near this
point lived the solitary Portuguese, John Ramalho,
surrounded by his half-breed descendants, and he
gave his countrymen a glad reception. He soon
showed them the way up the mountains to the high
plateau which begins only a few miles from the sea.
Another settlement was founded on these fertile
plains near the site of the present city of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<p>In the west of Brazil the settlements were established
at a striking distance from the coast, but in
S&atilde;o Paulo the colonists could more easily spread
over the open plains of the interior than along the
mountainous coast. On top of their plateau they
were cut off from ready communication with the
mother country; they struck out for themselves, and
their development was something like that of the
British in North America. They were the pioneers
of Brazil, corresponding closely in character and habits,
in the virtues of daring, hospitality, and self-confidence,
and in the vices of cruelty, rudeness, and
ignorance, with the pioneers of the Mississippi valley.</p>

<p>The Paulistas were all profoundly influenced by
their intimate association with the Indian tribes.
In the early days intermarriages were frequent, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the continual re-enforcement of the European element,
and the inferiority in capacity of reproduction
which the Indian has shown in Brazil, make the
traces of that intermixture hard to discover at the
present time. The Paulistas and their descendants
in the interior states are taller, slenderer, darker,
and more active and graceful than the modern Portuguese.
Their hands and feet are smaller, their
movements more nervous, their manners more self-confident.</p>

<p>The successful founding of a considerable colony
in Brazil aroused interest at home, and many courtiers
solicited the Crown for grants. It was decided
to partition the whole coast into feudal fiefs, each
proprietor undertaking the expenses of colonisation
and being given virtually sovereign powers in return
for a tax on the expected production. Each of
these "captaincies" measured fifty leagues along
the coast, and extended indefinitely into the interior.
In 1534 twelve such fiefs were created, covering the
whole coast from the mouth of the Amazon to the
island of Santa Catharina&mdash;these being the points
where the Tordesillas line met the seaboard.</p>

<p>Six of these proprietors succeeded in establishing
permanent colonies. Martim Affonso's settlement
has already been described. In 1536 his brother,
Pero Lopes, established Santo Amaro within a few
miles of S&atilde;o Vicente. Naturally its history soon
became confounded with that of the larger settlement.
Duarte Coelho founded Pernambuco in
1535, and in it was soon absorbed Itamarica, the
second of the two colonies founded by Pero Lopes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
in 1536. The other three permanent settlements
were Victoria, the nucleus of the present state of
Espirito Santo, Porto Seguro, and Ilheos. No one
of them prospered, and their territories are still
among the most backward parts of the Brazilian
coast. The donatory of the territory which included
the bay of Bahia, started a town, but it was
destroyed by Indians. The other five captaincies
were not taken hold of seriously by their proprietors.
The four nuclei for the settlement of Brazil were
S&atilde;o Paulo, Pernambuco, and the later colonies of
Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Martim Affonso recked little of his fief or its revenues
and left his Paulistas to work out their own
destiny. Pernambuco was on the track of every
ship which came to South America, the neighbouring
interior was level and easily accessible from
the coast, the soil and climate were suitable for
sugar, and from the beginning relations with the
mother country were intimate and continuous. Its
proprietor, Duarte Coelho, determined to devote
himself to his colony, and he personally headed a
numerous and carefully selected colonising expedition.
He spent the rest of his life there, and died
twenty years later, surrounded by a large and prosperous
colony, which was already a self-supporting
state with all the elements of permanence. A good
business man and liberal for that age, he granted
land on easy terms; its possession was secure; contributions
were moderate; and he resolutely defended
himself and his grantees from the exactions
of the Crown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>The Portuguese occupation of Brazil was induced
solely by commercial considerations. Explorers
and emigrants went out to make their fortunes, not
to escape religious or political tyranny. When the
first voyagers were disappointed in not finding gold
mines, they turned their attention to brazil-wood.
Soon the suitability of the territory for sugar was
discovered. The European demand for this luxury
was increasing, and the Portuguese had become
familiar with its culture in Africa. Cane was taken
from Madeira and the Cape Verdes to Brazil before
1525, and there is a record of exportation at least as
early as 1526. Here was found the basis for the
real colonisation. From the very start the industry
prospered in Pernambuco, and Brazil became the
main source of the world's supply.</p>

<p>Near Pernambuco little trouble was experienced
with the Indians. Many of the tribes were allies of
the Portuguese, though the fierce Aymor&eacute;s fought
the settlers and once reduced the infant colony to
the verge of destruction. Although the law of
Portugal forbade the enslavement of Indians except
as a punishment for crime, they were reduced to
bondage on a large scale in Pernambuco, and the
Paulistas never paid any attention to this prohibition.</p>

<p>By the middle of the sixteenth century Brazil
contained one rapidly expanding colony of sugar-planters,
Pernambuco, which gave sure promise of
wealth if not attacked from without,&mdash;a half dozen
moribund settlements on the thousand miles of
coast to the south, and an isolated but vigorous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
self-sufficing group in S&atilde;o Paulo, whose inhabitants
produced little for export, but who were reducing
the aborigines to slavery in an expanding circle. In
the last there was a considerable proportion of Indian
blood and in the first a large number of negroes.
The smaller captaincies were little more than resorts
for pirates and contraband traders in brazil-wood.
The settlers were powerless to prevent the French
expeditions which yearly became more numerous.
Serious apprehensions were felt that the French
would occupy the coast and make Brazil a basis for
attacks on Portugal's African and Indian empires.</p>

<p>The best blood of the Portuguese nation was being
drained away in exhausting wars and expeditions to
India and Africa; absolute government was sapping
civic vitality; the extravagances of Court and nobles
were impoverishing the country. However, enough
vitality remained, before the terrific destruction of
Portuguese power and pride at Alcacer-Kibir in
1580, to secure such a firm establishment of the Portuguese
race on the whole coast of Brazil that it
never has been dislodged, and only once seriously
threatened. This result was largely due to the
founding of a strong military and naval post at
Bahia, around which grew up a prosperous colony,
and under whose protection Pernambuco spread out
over the north-east coast, S&atilde;o Paulo developed uninterruptedly,
and Rio Bay was saved from the
French.</p>

<p>The first proprietary settlement in Bahia Bay had
been destroyed by the Indians, but this magnificent
and central harbour was manifestly the most con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>venient
point whence to send assistance to the other
settlements and guard the whole coast. In 1549 the
king determined to build a fortress and city there.
Thomas de Souza, the illegitimate scion of a great
house, was chosen the first governor-general. He
sailed in April, 1549, with six vessels, and accompanied
by three hundred and twenty officials and a
number of colonists. The new capital commanded
the entrance to a magnificent inland sea which offered
splendid facilities for the establishment of a
flourishing state. Bahia Bay is nearly a hundred
miles in circumference; its shores are fertile and
penetrated by rivers; each plantation has its own
wharves. Within a few months a town of a hundred
houses had been built, surrounded by a wall and defended
by batteries; a cathedral, a custom house, a
Jesuit college, and a governor's residence were under
way.</p>

<p>Thomas de Souza was instructed to strike at the
root of the difficulties that were supposed to have
prevented the success of the proprietary captaincies.
He was the direct representative of the king and had
supreme supervisory power. Other officers, however,
were associated with him who were independently
responsible in judicial, financial, and naval
matters. He was closely bound by instructions
covering every detail that could be foreseen, and
these instructions clearly show the centralising and
jealous spirit of Portuguese institutions and ideas.</p>

<p>Few Portuguese of that age were capable of rising
to an appreciation of the economical advantages of
freedom. The liberal concessions to the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
proprietors&mdash;free trade with the mother country, the
right of communication with foreign countries, and
judicial and administrative independence&mdash;availed
nothing. Neither colonists, proprietors, nor the
central government could understand or apply them.
Brazil was subjected to a systematic and continually
more rigorous exploitation by the home government,
and to the irresponsible and uncontrolled
military despotism of little satraps.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-344.jpg" width="800" height="355" alt="BAHIA." title="" />
<span class="caption">BAHIA.</span>
</div>

<p>In Bahia, as in Pernambuco, the sugar industry
prospered from the beginning.  Bahia is close to
Africa and navigation across is safe and easy. The
importation of blacks began immediately, and the
port continued to be the greatest <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> and distributing
point for the trade during three centuries.
Bahia's population is more largely black than that
of any other city in Brazil, and the pure African
type is frequently seen on its streets. The local
cuisine includes many dishes of African origin, and
the local dialect many African words.  Certain Af<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>rican
dialects are spoken to this day, and a few
Mohammedan negroes there still perform the rites
of the Koran in the most absolute secrecy.</p>

<p>The municipal government of the town, though
under the overshadowing power of the governor,
showed some vitality and independence. The fertile
island of Itaparica, just opposite the city, had been
granted to the mother of a minister. Though the
donation was repeatedly confirmed by the king himself,
she and her heirs were never able to put their
agents in possession. The municipal council successfully
insisted that the original royal instructions
to the governor required all grantees to occupy their
estates in person.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE JESUITS</h3>


<p>One of John III.'s strongest reasons for undertaking
a more extensive colonisation of Brazil
was the pious conviction that it was his Christian
duty to promote the dissemination of the true religion
in dominions which he owed to the gift of the
Holy Father. He was the first and most steadfast
friend of the Jesuits, then just organised and San
Francisco Xavier, the Apostle of the East Indies,
was sent out to one hemisphere, while the conversion
of the Brazilian aborigines was determined upon
in the other. With Thomas de Souza sailed an able
Jesuit, Manuel Nobrega, accompanied by several
other Fathers. They began a carefully planned
campaign to convert the Indians and, incidentally,
to exploit them in the interests of the Order.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to admire the courage, shrewdness,
and devotion of the Jesuits. They went out
alone among the savage tribes, living with them,
learning their languages, preaching to them, captivating
their imaginations by the pomp of religious
paraphernalia and processions, baptising them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
exhorting them to abandon cannibalism and polygamy.
Tireless and fearless, they plunged into an
interior hitherto unpenetrated by white men. The
reports they made to their superiors frequently
afford the best information that is yet extant as to
the customs of the Indians and the resources of the
regions they explored.</p>

<p>The Indians were easily induced to conform to
the externals of the Christian cult. Wherever the
Jesuits penetrated, the aborigines soon adopted
Christianity, but to hold the Indians to Christianity
the Fathers were obliged to fix them to the soil.
As soon as a tribe was converted, a rude church
building was erected, and a Jesuit installed, who remained
to teach agriculture and the arts as well as
ritual and morals. His moral and intellectual superiority
made him perforce an absolute ruler in
miniature. Thus that strange theocracy came into
being, which, starting on the Brazilian coast, spread
over most of central South America. In the early
part of the seventeenth century the theocratic
seemed likely to become the dominant form of government
south of the Amazon and east of the Andes.</p>

<p>The Jesuit wanted the Indian to himself, and
fought against the interference or enslavement by
the lay Portuguese. The colonists wanted the Indians
to work on their plantations, to incorporate
them as slaves, or in some analogous capacity, with
the white man's industrial and civil organisation.
The home government stood by the Jesuits, but the
colonists constantly evaded restrictions and steadily
fought the priests. The encouragement of the negro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
slave trade was an attempt at a compromise&mdash;intended
to induce the colonists to leave the Indians
alone by furnishing another supply of labour.</p>

<p>Primarily, at least, the Jesuit purpose was altruistic,
though the material advantages and the fascination
of exercising authority were soon potent
motives. The Jesuits gave the South American
Indian the greatest measure of peace and justice he
ever enjoyed, but they reduced him to blind obedience
and made him a tenant and a servant.
Though virtually a slave, he was, however, little
exposed to infection from the vices and diseases of
civilisation; he was not put at tasks too hard for
him; and under Jesuit rule he prospered. On the
other hand, if this system had prevailed there would
have been little white immigration, the Indian race
would have remained in possession of the country,
and real civilisation would never have gained a foothold.</p>

<p>Immediately after the founding of Bahia, Nobrega
sent members of the Order to the other colonies.
He himself visited Pernambuco, where the stout
old proprietor met him with effective opposition.
Duarte did not welcome a clergy responsible solely
to a foreign corporation, and over which he could
have no control. In Bahia and the south the Jesuits,
however, prospered amazingly. In S&atilde;o Paulo
they laboured hard, spread widely, converted a large
number of Indians, and perfected their system, but
it was there they came most sharply in conflict with
the spirit of individualism, and there they suffered
their first and most crushing overthrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas de Souza laboured diligently during the
four years of his administration, fortifying posts,
driving away contraband traders, dismissing incompetent
officials, and even building jails and
straightening streets where the local authorities had
neglected them. He visited all the captaincies south
of Bahia and entered Rio Bay, then the principal
rendezvous for the French privateers and traders.
He appreciated its strategic and commercial importance,
and was only prevented by lack of means from
establishing a strong post there. In S&atilde;o Paulo he
prohibited the flourishing trade which had grown
with the Spaniards in Paraguay and Buenos Aires.
Duarte da Costa, his successor, was accompanied by
a large re-enforcement of Jesuits. Among them was
Anchieta, one of the most notable men in the history
of the Order, whose genius, devotion, and
pertinacious courage laid the foundations of Jesuit
power so deeply in South America that its effects
remain to this day. This remarkable man was born
in Teneriffe, the son of a banished nobleman, who
had married a native of the island. Educated at
home, from his infancy he showed marvellous talents.
At fourteen, his father, not daring to risk his son's
life in Spain, sent him to the Portuguese University
at Coimbra. His career was so brilliant, the reputation
he acquired for profound and ready intelligence,
his eloquence, and his pure and elevated
ideals so remarkable, that he attracted the attention
of Simon Rodrigues, John III.'s great Jesuit minister,
who, like all the leaders of the Order, was on
the watch for talented young men.  The ardent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>youth was easily convinced that no career was so
glorious as that of a missionary, and when only
twenty years old he solicited and obtained permission
to go to Brazil. Nobrega, the Provincial,
selected him to go to S&atilde;o Paulo and establish a
school to train neophytes and proselytes into evangelists.
His own letter to Nobrega best tells what
a life he found and what sort of man he was:</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here we are, sometimes more than twenty of us together
in a little hut of mud and wicker, roofed with
straw, fourteen paces long and ten wide. This is at once
the school, the infirmary, dormitory, refectory, kitchen,
and store-room. Yet we covet not the more spacious
dwellings which our brethren have in other parts. Our
Lord Jesus Christ was in a far straiter place when it was
His pleasure to be born among beasts in a manger,
and in a still straiter when He deigned to die upon the
cross."</p></div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
</div>

<p>They herded together to keep warm, for in winter
it is cold on the S&atilde;o Paulo plateau. They had no
food except the mandioc flour, fish, and game which
the Indians gave them. To the little college came
Creoles and half-breeds and learned Latin, Portuguese,
Spanish, and Tupi. Anchieta was indefatigable.
Within a year he had acquired a complete
mastery of the Indian tongue, and had devised a
grammar for it. He wrote his own text-books, and
employed his great poetical talents in composing
hymns and verses to be chanted to the pupils, recounting
the stories of Holy Scripture. He visited
the most savage tribes in person, and acquired a
marvellous moral supremacy over them. When the
Tamoyos attacked the Portuguese, and the destruction
of all the southern settlements seemed inevitable,
he fearlessly went to the Indian camps and
persuaded the chiefs to consent to a truce while he
remained among them three years as a hostage to
guarantee its faithful performance by his countrymen.
The savages regarded him as more than human,
and tradition tells of the miracles he performed.
It is related that during these three years of solitary
captivity he composed, without the aid of pen or
paper, his Latin "Hymn to the Virgin," celebrated
as one of the masterpieces of ecclesiastical poetry.</p>

<p>He and his companions did not disdain to labour
with their hands. They used the spade and trowel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
made their own shoes, taught the Indians agriculture,
introduced new plants from Europe, practised
medicine, and studied the botany, topography, and
geology of the country. The villages of converted
Indians under their government and protection
rapidly spread over the S&atilde;o Paulo plains, and they
were refuges for Indians flying from slavery on the
plantations. The colonists pursued their fugitive
slaves, and soon were at open war with the Jesuits.
In the course of this conflict the original half-breed
settlement on the plateau was destroyed and the lay
Portuguese came near being wiped out. Peace was
temporarily patched up, but the Paulistas soon
turned the tables and compelled the Jesuits to devote
themselves to their educational institutions in
the towns, or to withdraw farther and farther into
the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>FRENCH OCCUPATION OF RIO</h3>


<p>During Duarte's administration troubles with
the Indians broke out along the whole coast.
In Bahia itself the new governor had disobeyed the
orders of the home government to protect the Indians.
He joined with the colonists in exploiting
them. A formidable Indian conspiracy was formed
and the settlements on both sides of the city were
simultaneously attacked. Many farms and villages
were sacked, but soon the Indians were finally and
crushingly defeated. The coast towns of S&atilde;o Paulo
were menaced by a great confederation of tribes
who used war canoes and had learned to overcome
their terror of firearms. At Espirito Santo the
Indian slaves rose <i>en masse</i>, killed most of the Portuguese,
and destroyed the sugar plantations.</p>

<p>A more serious danger was the settlement of the
French at Rio de Janeiro. They had formed friendly
relations with the Indians, and the name of Frenchman
was sufficient to insure good treatment from
most of the tribes, while that of Portuguese was a
signal for its bearer to be killed and devoured. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
was the epoch of the religious wars in France, and
the traders to Brazil came mostly from Huguenot
ports. Admiral Coligny conceived the idea of establishing
a Huguenot settlement in South America,
and Rio was chosen as the most available site.
In 1555 a considerable expedition was sent under
the command of Nicolas Villegagnon, a celebrated
adventurer, who had distinguished himself in escorting
Mary Queen of Scots from France to Scotland.
He fortified the island in Rio harbour that
still bears his name&mdash;a barren rock which commanded
the entrance and was safe from attacks by land.
The French kept on good terms with the neighbouring
Indians, and remained unmolested by the Portuguese
for four years. But Villegagnon was not
faithful to his employers, though most of his party
were Protestants, and Huguenot leaders had furnished
the money for the expedition. He quarrelled
with the Huguenots and finally gave up the command
and returned to France in the Guise interest.
Coligny's project of establishing a new and Protestant
France in South America lost its very good
chance of success. It is interesting to conjecture
what would have been the history of Brazil if Villegagnon
had stuck to the Huguenot side. In all
probability re-enforcements would have been sent,
and St. Bartholomew's Day&mdash;fourteen years later&mdash;might
have been followed by a great emigration like
that which went to New England during the Laud
persecution. Rio and perhaps the whole of South
Brazil would have become a French possession or a
French-speaking state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>Not until 1558 was a strong and able Portuguese
governor selected, and vigorous measures taken to
expel the French. The new governor was Mem da
Sa, a nobleman of the highest birth, a soldier, a
scholar, and an experienced administrator. His
name will always be associated with the establishment
of the Portuguese power in Brazil on a footing
firm and broad enough to enable it to withstand the
Dutch attacks and the lean years of Spanish domination.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival he took measures to quiet the
Indian slavery question by reducing the import duties
on black slaves and by aiding each planter to
acquire as many negroes as he needed to work his
plantation. When his ships and armament arrived
he proceeded to the south. He found that the
French, though weak in numbers, could count on
Indian allies. As he himself writes to the Court:
"The French do not treat the natives as we do.
They are very liberal to them, observing strict justice,
so that the commander is feared by his countrymen
and beloved by the Indians. Measures have
been taken to instruct the latter in the use of arms,
and as the aborigines are very numerous the French
may soon make themselves very strong." He
harassed the French and destroyed their fortifications
but could not completely dislodge them, and
returned to Bahia with his work only half accomplished.
Porto Seguro and Ilheos were attacked
by the ferocious Aymor&eacute;s and with difficulty saved
from total destruction. In the South another great
Tamoyo confederation had been formed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
deliberate purpose of rooting the Paulistas out of
the country and putting a stop once for all to their
slave-hunting. When all seemed lost, Anchieta intervened,
and succeeded in fixing up a peace. The
Tamoyos were cajoled into becoming allies of the
Portuguese in a final attempt to expel the French
from Rio. Mem da Sa's nephew appeared with a
considerable fleet, and after a desultory campaign of
a year the French were obliged to retire. France
did nothing to prevent or recover this inestimable
loss, and Mem da Sa immediately laid out and fortified
a city on a site which to-day is the business
centre of the capital of Brazil. From the time of
its founding Rio was the most important place in
southern Brazil and the key to the whole region,
but its great prosperity dates from a hundred and
fifty years later, when gold was discovered in Minas
Geraes.</p>

<p>Mem da Sa continued to rule Brazil until his death
in 1572. The work of centralisation went on apace,
fiscal and administrative officers were multiplied,
and taxes and restrictions imposed at will. The
Lisbon government laid the foundations of that restrictive
system which finally confined Brazil to
communication with the mother country. Nevertheless
most of the settlements grew rapidly. Sugar-planting,
cattle-raising, and general agriculture
flourished. The Indians were expelled or reduced
to impotence within striking distance of the centres
of population.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<span class="caption">PLANTERS GOING TO CHURCH.<br />
[From an old print.]</span>
</div>

<p>At Mem da Sa's death the civilised population
numbered about sixty thousand, of whom twenty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
thousand were white. The provinces of Pernambuco
and Bahia had each twenty-five thousand inhabitants.
Rio had some two thousand and S&atilde;o
Paulo perhaps five, the remainder being divided between
the smaller settlements&mdash;Parahyba, Rio Real,
Ilheos, Porto Seguro, and Espirito Santo. Except
in S&atilde;o Paulo most of the inhabitants were engaged
in sugar-raising. The hundred and twenty plantations
produced annually forty-five thousand tons of
sugar, while Portuguese goods to the value of a million
dollars a year were imported.</p>

<p>A sugar <i>fazenda</i>, or plantation, constituted a
little independent village, where the owner lived surrounded
by his slaves in their cabins, his shops and
stables, mills and mandioc fields. The grantees had
paid no purchase price for the land, and held it on
condition of paying a tenth of the product and a
tenth of that tenth, a tax which survives to the
present time, only it is now called an export duty of
eleven per cent. Land was not otherwise taxed, and
to this day direct taxes on farm property are almost
unknown, though imposts of every other conceivable
kind have been multiplied. The tracts granted
were large; the owner could hold them unused without
expense; the most powerful incentive to sale
and division of land did not, therefore, exist. Brazil
became and remains a country of large rural proprietorship.
Landowners are reluctant to sell or
divide their estates, taxes on transfers are excessive,
and land is not freely bought and sold. Consequently
the rural population is widely scattered,
grants extend far beyond the limits of actual settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>ment,
there are few small farmers and very little
careful culture. Brazil is a country of staple crops
and non-diversified agriculture. A fall in sugar or
coffee produces a disproportionate disturbance in
financial conditions, and land not suitable to the
staple crop of a region is left to lie idle. Immigration
has been retarded because land has been hard
to obtain except by special government concession,
and because private owners do not care
to sell their land to settlers. Except in restricted
cases, the rural immigration&mdash;negro and
South European&mdash;has been for the purpose of
furnishing labour for the large proprietors, and not
to form a landowning and permanently established
population.</p>

<p>The Jesuit travellers describe the Brazilian people
in 1584 as pleasure-loving and extravagant. In the
sugar provinces fortunes were very unequal. In
Pernambuco alone more than a hundred planters
had incomes of ten thousand dollars a year. Their
capital, Olinda&mdash;now the northern suburb of the
city of Pernambuco&mdash;was the largest town in Brazil
and the one where there was most luxurious living
and the most polite society. In general the people
were spendthrifts, and notwithstanding large incomes
were heavily in debt. Great sums were
spent on f&ecirc;tes, religious processions, fairs, and dinners.
The simple Jesuit Fathers were shocked to see such
velvets and silks, such luxurious beds of crimson
damask, such extravagance in the trappings of
the saddle-horses. Carriages were unknown, and
instead litters and sedan chairs were used, and these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
remained in common use in Bahia until very recent
times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 740px;">
<img src="images/illus-360.jpg" width="740" height="600" alt="A CADEIRA." title="" />
<span class="caption">A CADEIRA.</span>
</div>

<p>From Pernambuco and Bahia communication with
the mother country was constant and easy. S&atilde;o
Paulo, however, differed radically from the sugar
districts. Wheat, barley, and European fruits grew
on the S&atilde;o Paulo plateau, but there was little export
to Portugal, and imported clothes were scarce and
dear. The Paulistas were constantly on horseback
and wore the old Portuguese costume of cloak and
close-fitting doublet long after it had been disused
at home.</p>

<p>Bahia and Pernambuco were fairly well built
towns, though unfortunately in the Portuguese style<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of architecture, whose solid walls, few windows, and
contiguous houses make it ill adapted to a tropical
climate. In spite of its unsuitability it was universally
adopted, and even yet largely prevails in
Brazil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>EXPANSION</h3>


<p>In 1581 Philip II. of Spain succeeded in establishing
himself on the throne of Portugal as the
successor of the rash Sebastian, dead fighting the
Moors at Alcacer-Kebir. The decadent and demoralised
Portuguese nation made hardly the semblance
of a struggle for its independence. The very
ease with which Philip obtained the kingdom left
him no pretext for depriving it of administrative independence.
Native Portuguese continued to hold
office in the colonies and to enjoy a monopoly of
Brazilian commerce. Internally, therefore, the
change did not much affect Brazil. But in foreign
relations the effect was profound. Brazil became a
part of a well-nigh universal monarchy, and one of
the battle-fields of the struggle which had begun between
Spain and the Protestant powers.</p>

<p>All South America was now under the same
monarch; boundary questions between Portuguese
and Spanish America apparently ceased to have any
importance. The enormous extension of Brazil toward
the interior over territory formerly conceded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
to be Spanish occurred during the sixty years of
Spanish domination. The Spanish monarch did
not have time to spend on Brazilian matters, and
the colonists were less interfered with from Lisbon
and Madrid than might have been expected. Portuguese
historians have much exaggerated the evil
effects of the English, Dutch, and French half
filibustering, half-trading descents on the coast,
which occurred during this period. The pillage of
a few towns was more than compensated by the
commerce that sprang up; much Brazilian sugar
escaped paying the heavy export duties; settlement
extended rapidly over new territory, and the importation
of negroes continued.</p>

<p>As early as 1575 a settlement had been made in
Sergipe, but the great expansion over northern Brazil
began under the rule of Philip's first governor-general.
In 1583 he sent troops to take possession
of the important port of Parahyba, where some
French traders had obtained a foothold that prevented
the inhabitants of Pernambuco from spreading
north beyond Itamarica. The Spanish mercenaries
were at first successful, but they could not stifle the
serious Indian war which broke out. The Pernambucanos
had better success, because they knew how
to take advantage of the dissensions among the
savages. Fortifying a town at Parahyba, they permanently
established their sugar plantations in its
neighbourhood, and then these indefatigable and
land-hungry Creoles pushed on farther to the north.
In 1597 Jeronymo de Albuquerque, the greatest of
Brazilian colonial generals, attacked and defeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the powerful Pitagoares Indians, and established the
colony of Natal, the nucleus of the present state of
Rio Grande do Norte. This brought the Pernambucanos
to Cape St. Roque. To the south they
had spread as far as the San Francisco River, there
meeting the Bahianos who, by 1589, had taken possession
of the present state of Sergipe.</p>

<p>North of St. Roque the Portuguese so far had
done nothing except make some desultory voyages
of observation, though they claimed the coast to
and beyond the mouth of the Amazon. The donatories
of the captaincies in that region had not succeeded
in establishing any settlements. In 1541,
Orellana, one of those recklessly heroic Spaniards
who had helped Pizarro conquer the empire of the
Incas, was a member of an expedition which crossed
the Andes near Quito and descended into the forested
plains, looking for another Peru&mdash;the fabled
El Dorado. They finally found themselves on a
great river flowing to the east, and, since their provisions
were exhausted, boats were built and Orellana
was sent on ahead to try to find supplies. He
could not find enough to feed the main body and
decided to float on down the river, well knowing it
must finally bring him to the ocean. After a voyage
of more than three thousand miles he came to the
great estuary of the Amazon and thence made his
way to Spain. No important results followed this
wonderful discovery. Orellana himself shortly returned
to the mouth of the river, but he could not
find his way up the labyrinth of waters.</p>

<p>To reach the plains from the Pacific or Caribbean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
settlements is nearly impracticable, and the Amazon
valley remained unsettled. Meanwhile the seed
planted by old Duarte Coelho germinated and grew
into a vigorous tree whose branches were spreading
out over all North Brazil. The seventeenth century
had hardly begun when the hardy Pernambucanos
invaded the country lying north and west of St.
Roque, hunting Indian slaves, and good places for
cattle- and sugar-raising. In 1603 Pero Coelho, an
adventurous Brazilian then living at Parahyba, made
a settlement far to the north-west of Natal, on the
coast of Cear&aacute;, and penetrated eight hundred miles
from Pernambuco. Unreasonable aggressions against
the Indians brought on temporary reverses, but the
Pernambucanos persevered, and the Jesuits also established
missions. By 1610 the region was pretty
well under white control, the Indians being incorporated
to a greater extent than was usual in the settlements
farther south.</p>

<p>The next forward movement was precipitated by
a formidable French attempt to colonise Maranh&atilde;o.
Daniel de la Rivardi&egrave;re, a Huguenot nobleman, conceived
the idea of carrying out on the north coast
Coligny's plan of a French Protestant colony. In
1612 he landed on the island of Maranh&atilde;o with a
large and well-appointed expedition.</p>

<p>Jeronymo de Albuquerque fortunately happened
to be on the north coast when news came of this
alarming intrusion. Sending his ships on to ascertain
the truth of the report, he hastened overland
to Pernambuco to get a force together. With three
hundred whites and two hundred Indians he started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
to expel the French. An assault on a fort defended
with artillery was out of the question, so in his turn
he fortified himself, cut off the French from access
to the sea, and ambushed their foraging expeditions.
In such a game, his men, inured to the climate, had
an immense advantage. Forced to assault Albuquerque's
position, the French were repulsed. They
begged for a truce, and went home at the end of a
year. Albuquerque took possession of the French
town, and in 1616 secured all the rest of the northern
coast to Portugal by founding Par&aacute;, just to the
south of the mouth of the Amazon. Several settlements
were made along the coast east of Par&aacute; and
also west in the estuary itself. The Indians proved
docile and were easily incorporated to so great an
extent that the Indian element is more predominant
in Par&aacute; than in any other state on the Brazilian
littoral.</p>

<p>On the island and around the bay of Maranh&atilde;o a
prosperous colony grew up. Certain enterprising
business men made a contract with the government
and started a regular propaganda for immigrants, and
induced a large number to come from the Azores.
The state thus founded was one of the most prosperous
in Brazil, and was especially celebrated for
the politeness and cultivation of its inhabitants.
Some of the greatest names in Portuguese literature
are those of Maranhenses. It is commonly said that
the best Portuguese is spoken in Maranh&atilde;o, and
not in Lisbon, Rio, or Porto&mdash;just as the English
of Dublin, Aberdeen, or Boston is considered better
than that of London or New York, and the Spanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of Lima and Bogot&aacute; better than that of Madrid,
Barcelona, or Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Meanwhile population and wealth had been increasing
satisfactorily in the older provinces south
of Cape St. Roque. By 1626 Pernambuco and
Bahia had grown to be towns of something like ten
thousand inhabitants, and the people of the respective
provinces numbered about a hundred thousand.
Ilheos, Porto Seguro, and Espirito Santo had
made no progress, but Rio had become a city of six
thousand, while the shores of her bay and the adjacent
coast were now fairly settled. Rio and Santos
really performed the function of ports for the foreign
commerce of Paraguay and the Argentine because
the Spanish laws did not permit these colonies to
have ports of their own. Campos was now settled
and its sugar industry was prospering. On the S&atilde;o
Paulo plains the Paulistas had spread to the north-east
to the headwaters of the Parahyba and borders
of the present state of Rio, and north-west down
the navigable Tiet&eacute;, along which they found an easy
track for their expeditions in search of slaves. The
Jesuits had long since been unable to control or
check the Paulistas, and had abandoned the missions
near the coast. In the remote interior, along the
Paran&aacute; and its great tributaries, the defeated priests
thought that they would be safe, and about the end
of the sixteenth century they entered that region
by way of Paraguay. The Paulistas recked little of
the government, especially now that the king was
Spanish, and, advancing the claim that Spanish
Jesuits had established missions on Portuguese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
territory, they proceeded to wipe out the new
missions.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that their little bands could
have penetrated such distances and accomplished
such results, but it is on record that they tracked
nearly to the Andes, and practically exterminated,
the aboriginal population of half Brazil. The Jesuits
tell us that between 1614 and 1639 four hundred
Paulistas with two thousand Indian allies captured
and killed three hundred thousand natives. In 1632
they utterly destroyed the great Jesuit settlements
on the Upper Paran&aacute;, though this involved an expedition
of fifteen hundred miles, much of which
is to this day rarely penetrable. One of their expeditions
was like an ambulating village&mdash;women,
children, and domestic animals accompanying it.
They sometimes were obliged to stop, sow a crop,
and wait for it to mature before they could proceed.
For the time being, these predatory Paulistas almost
reverted to the nomadic stage.</p>

<p>Naturally, no complete record of these expeditions
survives. Their members were not literate men, and
it is only when they fought the Jesuits, or when
they discovered minerals, that a record of their
routes has been preserved. We know that before
1632 they had traversed all of southern Brazil, and
Paraguay, and even eastern Argentina and Uruguay.
Incursions to the north and west followed
shortly. There is an authentic record of an expedition
reaching Goyaz as early as 1647, and it is
probable that by that time they had penetrated the
central plateau which stretches across to the Andes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
had seen the headwaters of the southern tributaries
of the Amazon, and had followed the eastern mountain
chain almost to the northern ocean. The Paulistas
secured to their country and their race more
than a million square miles of fertile and salubrious
territory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE DUTCH CONQUEST</h3>


<p>By the end of the sixteenth century Holland was
practically independent, and the "Beggars of
the Sea" were carrying her arms and trade all over
the world. Numerous private companies of Dutch
merchants made war against Spain on their own account,
and great fortunes were made in the capture
of Spanish fleets and in trade with Spanish and Portuguese
colonies. The Dutch East India Company
within a few years possessed itself of the better part
of the Portuguese empire in the Indian Ocean, and
the West India Company was organised to do the
same in South America. Incorporated in 1621, it included
various smaller companies already engaged in
trade and privateering, and was an immense corporation
which finally owned more than eight hundred
ships, and sent to Brazil alone more than seventy
thousand troops. Although protected, subsidised,
and conceded a monopoly by the Dutch government,
it always remained essentially a company for
private profit.</p>

<p>The Company's primary object was to capture the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Spanish treasure fleets; its secondary object was to
conquer the possessions of Spain and Portugal in
South America. Brazil furnished the best base for
the operations that were intended to make the
South Atlantic a Dutch lake; Bahia and Pernambuco
were near Europe, had good harbours, lay on the
direct route to the Plate and the Pacific, and from
them Africa could be conveniently attacked. The
sugar trade was a large thing in itself and the daring
Dutch traders believed that the Portuguese colonists
might welcome a deliverance from Spanish domination.
Spain's power was a rotten shell, and impulses
lying deep in the national spirit pushed the Dutch
on to aggression. The peoples of Western Europe
had finally felt all the stimulating influences of the
Renaissance, of the Lutheran and Jesuit Reformations,
and of the Era of Discovery. It was the
epoch of the Thirty Years' War, of the League of
Avignon, and of that confused fighting caused by
the more vigorous peoples grasping for a share of
the spoils of the New World.</p>

<p>In 1623 news came of the equipping by the West
India Company of an expedition whose destination
was manifestly to be Bahia. The Spanish government
took no measures for defence. The local
authorities half-heartedly began to fortify the city,
but there were no troops except militia to man the
works, and when the Dutch fleet hove in sight a
panic ensued. The governor was captured, but
many of the inhabitants fled into the back country,
and a guerrilla warfare was kept up which shut up
the Dutch inside the fortifications. They made use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of their time in improving the defences, and soon
made Bahia the best fortress in South America.</p>

<p>The news of the capture created consternation in
Lisbon. Great exertions were made by the Portuguese
merchants, as well as by the Spanish government,
and the most formidable armament which up
to that time had crossed the equator was prepared.
It was composed of fifty-two ships and of twelve
thousand men&mdash;the latter being mercenaries gathered
from every country in Europe. The Dutch
commander had not yet been re-enforced and made
little resistance when such an overwhelming force
arrived in Bahia harbour. He surrendered with the
honours of war and the Spanish fleet retired. In a
few weeks another Dutch fleet appeared, bringing
provisions and re-enforcements. It was too late,
however, and the Dutch did not venture to attack
an enemy whom they themselves had furnished with
such excellent re-enforcements. The Dutch, driven
from the land, remained undisputed masters of the
sea, and the Spanish and Portuguese could no longer
trade except in convoys. In 1627 the celebrated
Piet Heyn&mdash;the Dutch Sir Francis Drake&mdash;sailed
boldly into Bahia harbour, and despising the fire of
the forty guns of the forts, captured twenty-six ships
within pistol-shot of the shore cannon. He ran his
own ship right in between the two best Portuguese
men-of-war, the forts did not dare fire for fear of
wounding their own men, the Portuguese flagship
was sunk, and the rest surrendered in terror.
Among the spoils were three thousand hogsheads
of sugar, which Piet Heyn sent home at his leisure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
while he ravaged the shores of the bay. The following
year he fell in with the Mexican treasure fleet
and captured it bodily. This was the greatest capture
ever made at sea. The West India Company
declared a dividend of fifty per cent. after paying
the expenses of the unsuccessful Bahia expedition,
and resumed its plans of conquest with more vigour
than ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-373.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="OLD FORT AT BAHIA." title="" />
<span class="caption">OLD FORT AT BAHIA.</span>
</div>

<p>After careful consideration Pernambuco was selected
as a more vulnerable point of attack than Bahia.
The fortifications were feeble, and there were
numerous Jewish merchants in the city whose
friendship could be counted on. Once more the
Spanish government did nothing to avert the
threatened blow, and in February, 1630, a Dutch
fleet of fifty sail with seven thousand men arrived in
front of Pernambuco. Three thousand men were
landed to the north of the town and easily defeated
the militia which tried to prevent their taking the
place from the rear. The inhabitants fled to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
interior, and after a creditable resistance the forts fell.
The property captured was estimated at near ten
million dollars. In the meantime, Albuquerque, the
Brazilian commander, had retired to a defensible
ranch commanding the road between Recife and
Olinda, and whence communication could be kept up
with the sea by way of Cape St. Augustine. This
ranch is celebrated in Brazilian tradition as the "Arraial
de Bom Jesus." The Brazilians rallied and from
this vantage-ground began to harass the Dutch. The
promises of commercial, religious, and political tolerance
had produced little effect on the more ardent
spirits. The Indians remained faithful to the Portuguese,
and with the negroes did good service in the
guerrilla warfare. For the first two years the Dutch
could accomplish little except to improve the fortifications
around the town, and the Brazilians acquired
a confidence in their own ability to make head
against regular troops which later stood them in
good stead.</p>

<p>In 1631 a fleet of twenty ships appeared from
Spain, but the Dutch Admiral sailed boldly out and
gave them battle. The net results to the Spaniards
were the landing of only a thousand men, who, after
some difficulty, joined the militia at Bom Jesus.
But the seeds of discontent were germinating among
the Brazilians. On closer contact the heretics
proved to be human. The planters wanted peace
and an opportunity to sell their sugar. The Indians,
negroes, and other adventurous spirits composing
the guerrilla bands robbed both friend and foe.
The soldiers were tired of serving without pay. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
half-breed named Calabar, a man of remarkable
bravery, cunning, and skill in woodcraft, deserted
to the Dutch and gave them valuable assistance.
Re-enforcements came from Holland, and under
Calabar's guidance the Dutch learned the value of
ambuscading and made sudden expeditions which
took the important settlements by surprise.</p>

<p>In 1633 two special representatives of the Company
came with instructions to prosecute the war
vigorously and to endeavour to conciliate the Brazilians.
The latters' resistance weakened; many of
Albuquerque's volunteers deserted; the Dutch expeditions
up and down the coast were successful.
The island of Itamarica, Rio Grande do Norte,
Parahyba, and the settlements in Alagoas were successively
reduced. Resistance was soon confined to
the country just back of Pernambuco itself, and in
1635 the last posts which held out&mdash;Bom Jesus and
St. Augustine&mdash;surrendered. The whole coast from
the San Francisco River north to Cape St. Roque
was in the hands of the Dutch. There was nothing
for it but submission or emigration. Many laid down
their arms, but Albuquerque and his faithful lieutenants,
the negro Dias and the Indian Camarr&atilde;o, reluctantly
took their way toward Bahia, the only place
of refuge. The Brazilian historians claim that ten
thousand Pernambucanos, men, women, and children,
accompanied Albuquerque, preferring to leave
their homes, property, and friends rather than accept
the foreign and heretic yoke. A sweet bit of
revenge awaited them on their journey. Encountering
and overpowering a small Dutch garrison at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Porto Calvo, they took its members prisoners, and
among them found the traitor, Calabar. Him they
hanged, while the Dutchmen were let go unharmed.</p>

<p>When Albuquerque reached the San Francisco he
was replaced by a Spaniard, Rojas, who had brought
re-enforcements of seventeen hundred Spanish
troops. The new commander gave battle to the
Hollanders, but in the first action was utterly defeated
and lost his own life. For the next two years
Pernambuco was ravaged by the most frightful burnings
and massacres. The Spanish mercenaries and
the bands of negroes and Indians scoured the interior,
and the Dutch retaliated with the same
methods. The prosperous colony was fast being
depopulated and its industries ruined. It became
manifest that a policy at once vigorous and conciliatory
was necessary, and the Company determined to
send out a governor-general with vice-regal powers.</p>

<p>The merchants of the Directory chose Count John
Maurice, of Nassau-Siegen, a scion of the reigning
house, and a descendant of William the Silent. A
more fortunate selection could not have been made.
Though only thirty-two years old, Count Maurice
had already proved himself a brave and skilful
soldier; he was a man of culture, a thorough son of
the Renaissance, a lover of the arts, and, like most
of his house, religiously tolerant and liberal to an
extent extraordinary for that bitter age. He was
one of those few spirits, in advance of their time, to
whom Catholic and Protestant, Jew and Gentile
were the same&mdash;to whose instincts religious and
commercial intolerance was repugnant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>He arrived in 1637, and his keen eye at once saw
that the two obstacles to pacification were the military
raids which the new Spanish commander, Bagnuoli,
was directing from his position near the San
Francisco; and the fear of the Pernambuco sugar
planters that Dutch dominion meant their forcible
conversion to Calvinism. The Dutch troops were
now well equipped and seasoned for warfare in the
tropical woods, and their officers had learned how
to exercise their trade under these difficult circumstances
with all the coolness, shrewdness, and steadiness
of their race. Commanded by Maurice they
easily inflicted a crushing defeat upon the motley
crew Bagnuoli had been able to gather. The whole
country north of the San Francisco fell into Maurice's
hands, and he crossed that river and destroyed
the Brazilian base of supplies in Sergipe. The next
year he was ordered by the Directory to attack Bahia
with insufficient forces, and was compelled to retire
after a forty-days siege. Two years later, however,
his fleet defeated and nearly destroyed the largest
naval force Spain had sent out since the Invincible
Armada. Of the six thousand soldiers on board who
had been expected to drive him from Brazil, only
one thousand were landed, away north of Cape St.
Roque, whence they barely managed to reach Bahia
after a march of over a thousand miles through the
wilderness, suffering the most frightful hardships.
Maurice followed up this victory by occupying
Sergipe (1640) and Maranh&atilde;o (1641). Cear&aacute; had
fallen into his hands in 1637. The whole of Brazil
from the 3rd to the 12th degree of latitude, a solid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
body of territory containing more than two-thirds
of the population and developed resources, was apparently
irretrievably lost to the Portuguese. They
only retained Bahia and the isolated settlements in
Par&aacute; and the southern provinces.</p>

<p>In internal administration Maurice was equally
vigorous. He suppressed the exactions of Dutch
soldiers and functionaries, and established law, order,
and justice. Agriculture, industry, and commerce
flourished as never before. He found Recife
a miserable port village and left it a city of two
thousand houses. He does not seem to have made
any especial exertions to secure Dutch immigration.
The Brazilians were not displaced as landed proprietors,
and most of the plantations confiscated
from the persistently rebellious were resold to Brazilians
who accepted the Dutch rule. He permitted
to Romanists and Jews the free and public exercise
of their faith. Many Jews came to Pernambuco,
and with their characteristic capacity soon became
prominent and useful in the commercial life of the
colony. The courts were so organised as to secure
representation for Brazilians. He summoned a sort
of legislature of the principal colonists&mdash;the first representative
assembly on South American soil&mdash;and
put into effect the measures it proposed. Local
administration was entrusted to Brazilians, and his
aim was evidently to make the colony self-governing.</p>

<p>But this positivist of the seventeenth century, this
genial pagan who had caught the essential spirit of
the Renaissance and had the courage to put it into
practice centuries before it became dominant even in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the realm of thought, was too far in advance of his
time. His countrymen could not understand him or
his ideas, and the Portuguese colonists were equally
incapable of appreciating what he was trying to do
for them. His edifice scattered like a card house the
moment he left. To all appearances every vestige
of his work was swept away; it is only a memory
and an example; a wave that dashed far up the
beach at the beginning of the flood-tide, leaving a
mark that long served only to show how far the
water had once come. It remained for the nineteenth
century and another nation of shopmen to
put into practice, on a scale large enough to convince
the world, the great principle of non-interference by
the central government with the religious beliefs
and the local self-government of colonies.</p>

<p>The moneyed aristocrats of the West India Company
distrusted Maurice as a member of a reigning
family which was maintained in power by its popularity
with the masses. The Directory wanted immediate
profits, not an empire established on a broad
and sure foundation. In their hearts they preferred
a steward and bookkeeper to a prince and a statesman.
The Calvinist clergy bitterly complained of
the liberties conceded their Catholic competitors for
tithes, and succeeded in imposing on Maurice the
execution of the prohibition against religious processions&mdash;then
as now so dear to the Brazilian heart.
Spies were sent out to report on him and he was
continually hampered.</p>

<p>Among the Brazilians he was equally misunderstood.
While personally so popular that not one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
their chroniclers has a word of dispraise for him,
they could not forget that he was of a different race
and religion, and he did not succeed in converting
them to his ideas. His best personal friends were
among those most influential, after his departure, in
stirring up the exclusive Brazilian feeling.</p>

<p>Maurice was not a man to be easily daunted. For
seven years he remained in office, fighting the Directory,
the Calvinist ministers, the corrupt officials,
trying to reconcile the jealousies between
Dutchmen and Brazilians, and to create a homogeneous
community. But after the power of the Nassau
family began to decline with the rise of the Witt
oligarchy, the Directory determined to be rid of him.
In 1644 he made a vigorous demand for more troops,
and when it was refused sent in a Bismarckian resignation,
which, to his surprise, was immediately accepted
with many polite protestations of thanks for
his services.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>EXPULSION OF THE DUTCH</h3>


<p>Four years before Maurice's retirement Portugal
broke loose from Spain, and that part of Brazil
which had escaped conquest by the Dutch promptly
threw off the Spanish yoke. In Europe Holland
and the new Portugal were naturally in alliance, but
the former was not magnanimous enough to stop her
aggressions in Brazil, and the latter was too weak
to resent them. Among the Brazilians dissatisfaction
began to brew as soon as Maurice left.
The prohibition of religious processions, the severe
financial crisis among planters who were unable to
pay off the heavy mortgages which they had given
when they purchased confiscated plantations, the
low price of sugar, and the impulse to national feeling
given by the news of the success of the mother
country in achieving independence all co-operated.</p>

<p>The opportunity brought forth the man. The
head of the rebellion was John Fernandes Vieira,
who is the great creator of the Brazilian nationality.
A native of Madeira, he ran away as a boy to seek
his fortune in Brazil. Engaged at first in menial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
employments, his honesty and capacity soon enabled
him to strike out for himself as a sugar planter.
When the Dutch attacked Pernambuco in 1630 he
took up arms, and only surrendered when Bom Jesus
fell. Convinced that further resistance was useless
he returned to his business and within ten years was
the richest man in the colony. Though a devoted
Catholic and a patriotic Portuguese, he was one of
Maurice's most trusted advisers. When the Prince
departed John Fernandes thenceforward devoted
his life to the expulsion of the Dutch.</p>

<p>The first revolt occurred in Maranh&atilde;o, where the
small Dutch garrison had to abandon that captaincy
as early as 1644. In Pernambuco John Fernandes
organised a formidable conspiracy, and letters were
despatched to the new Portuguese king asking his
aid. John IV. did not dare to comply openly, for
such action might have involved him in a war with
the States-General, but the governor-general at Bahia
was as unscrupulous as he was patriotic, and
secretly afforded the conspirators every facility in
his power. The celebrated chiefs of the guerrilla
fighting of 1630 to 1635, Vidal, Camarr&atilde;o, and Dias,
were only too anxious to have another chance, and
gathered their bands in the wilderness. Arms were
obtained from Bahia, and in 1645 the insurrection
broke out. The first move was to have been the
massacre of the principal Hollanders, but the plot
was discovered and the conspirators fled for their
lives to the interior. At a place called Tabocas
John Fernandes gathered a motley crew of a few
hundred together.  Only three hundred of his fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>lowers
had muskets, but they were protected by
marshy ground in front, and the hill was surrounded
by almost impenetrable cane-brakes. There on the
3rd of August the Dutch troops to the number of a
thousand found and attacked the Brazilians. The
bulk of the population was standing aloof, his camp
was full of mutiny, nevertheless John Fernandes
stood firm. The Dutch charged confidently, but
they could not use their firearms to advantage, and
the Brazilians showed the traditional valour of their
race in the use of pike and sword. The Dutch were
not able to dislodge the rebels, and after losing three
hundred and seventy men they retreated to Pernambuco,
leaving the insurgents with all the moral prestige
of victory.</p>

<p>The whole province rose; the troops, which had
come from Bahia ostensibly to aid the Dutch in
pacifying the province, went over <i>en masse</i> to the
patriots; the Dutch garrisons in the outlying towns
were everywhere attacked and everywhere retreated.
A few grudgingly paid mercenaries were not the
material with which to defend such an empire.
Within a few months the Dutch were expelled from
the interior and shut themselves up in the fortified
seaports waiting for re-enforcements. The Indians
and guerrillas spread fire and destruction through
Itamarica, Parahyba, Rio Grande do Norte, and
Cear&aacute;. In spite of this sudden success the position
of the patriots was very critical. Without the aid
of regular troops they could hardly hope to make
head against the Dutch so soon as the latter received
adequate re-enforcements. The news of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
insurrection aroused great indignation in Holland.
The house of the Portuguese ambassador was surrounded
by an infuriated mob, and his government
had to disavow the rebellion. Willing as John IV.
might be to help the Brazilians, he dare not. By
the middle of 1646 an able commander, von
Schoppke, arrived from Holland with a fine army.
At first John Fernandes and the militia did not dare
meet him in the field. The provincials hovered
about the Dutch columns, cutting off detachments,
and burning sugar plantations in the line of march.
John Fernandes set the example by ordering the
destruction of his own property.</p>

<p>In 1647 Barreto de Menezes, an able professional
soldier, arrived in Brazil bearing a secret commission
from the Portuguese king. The bickering and
despairing provincials made no difficulty about
recognising it, and Barreto at once began uniting
the scattered militia bands and the few regulars who
had clandestinely come up from Bahia.</p>

<p>A few miles south of Pernambuco the low hills
encroach on the coast-plain, leaving only a narrow
pass between themselves and the marshes.
Schoppke made a sortie along the coast road with
the largest part of his force,&mdash;about four thousand
men,&mdash;and there at the hills of Guararapes found the
patriot army, numbering two thousand two hundred.
Encamped across the level ground they barred his
way, with the evident intention of giving him battle,
and there on the 18th of August, 1648, was fought
out the question whether Brazil should be Dutch or
Portuguese. The defeat of the patriots would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
meant the hopeless collapse of the rebellion and the
giving up by poor little Portugal of the last vestige
of her claim to Brazil. Success meant that they
might prolong the war for years and finally tire out
Holland, or give the Portuguese government a
chance to do something by negotiation.</p>

<p>The battle began with the Dutch taking possession
of the higher ground whence their artillery inflicted
some damage, but when they charged down
the hill, attempting to outflank and surround the
Brazilians, there ensued a confused and desperate
struggle with cold steel. The regulars proved no
match for these farmers, who were fighting for their
homes and religion. The Dutch battalions broke and
fled up the hill, followed by the Brazilians. Then
the Dutch reserve came into action and the battle
rolled back to the low ground, where the result was
decided face to face and man to man. Some of the
braver of the Dutch imprudently went through the
Brazilian lines into the marshes, where they suffered
terrible slaughter at the hands of the reserve. More
than a thousand Hollanders perished, with seventy-four
officers. Thirty-three standards remained in
the hands of the Brazilians, and the remnants of the
Dutch army fled to the shelter of the walls of Pernambuco.
The cowardice shown by many of his
troops is the only excuse offered by the Dutch general
for this shameful defeat suffered at the hands of
a militia inferior not only in equipment and artillery,
but in numbers and advantage of position.</p>

<p>The descendants of the victors at Guararapes
have never forgotten that it was a Brazilian and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
a Portuguese triumph. The Brazilians proved to
their own satisfaction that their resources were sufficient
to defend their institutions, and it has been
well said that on that day the Brazilian nation was
born.</p>

<p>The parsimonious merchants whose money was
invested in the Company made a half-hearted effort
to retrieve this unexpected reverse, but re-enforcements
were sent out so grudgingly that a similar
sortie next year was even more overwhelmingly
defeated at the very same place. Even then the
Brazilian hopes of ultimate success would have
been small if at this very juncture the world-power
of Holland had not received its first great check by
the breaking out of the war with Oliver Cromwell.
With English fleets sweeping the North Sea and
Blake's cannon thundering at the Texel, the States-General
had no forces to spare on far-away Brazil.
The patriots kept the Dutch shut up in Pernambuco
and were undisputed masters of the rest of the province.
So long as communication by sea remained
open the Dutch, however, could maintain themselves
indefinitely. Re-enforcements might come
at any time from Holland and the negotiations by
Portugal were uncertain, and might, indeed, lead to
Brazil's being exchanged for an advantage elsewhere.</p>

<p>John Fernandes steadfastly maintained the siege,
urging his followers not to lay down their arms so
long as a Dutchman remained in Brazil. The pusillanimous
Portuguese king did not dare help the Pernambucanos,
and neither was he honest enough to
abide by the treaties he had made with Holland, giv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>ing
up all claim to North Brazil. Matters remained
in this anomalous position until 1654, when John
Fernandes by a single audacious stroke cut through
the tangle made by complicated and timid European
diplomacy.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1653 the annual Bahia fleet sailed
from the Tagus, convoyed by powerful men-of-war.
The Dutch had no naval force on the South American
coast able to cope with it. When the
Portuguese fleet hove in sight of Pernambuco, the
Brazilian commanders from their fortified besieging
camp just to the south of the city entered into
communication with the Admiral. John Fernandes
begged the latter to lend him some cannon for a
few days and meanwhile to blockade the port. The
patriot leader saw that the isolated garrison of
mercenaries would have no heart to hold out for
long. The Portuguese Admiral refused, saying,
truly enough, that he had no instructions to aid the
insurgent Brazilians, and that he did not care to risk
his head by precipitating a war between Portugal
and Holland. Fernandes answered that with or
without his aid the assault would be made, and the
Admiral yielded to his natural feelings and lent the
Brazilians some big guns. John Fernandes planted
them where they commanded an outlying fort he
knew to be vital to the city's defences. Schoppke
was compelled to retire within the central city; the
Brazilians made successful night assaults on several
positions, and drew their lines closer and closer
until the place was untenable. On the 26th of January,
1655, the Dutch general signed a capitulation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
surrendering not only Pernambuco, but all the other
places held by the Dutch in Brazil. His twelve
hundred troops were given safe passage home, and
all resident Hollanders were allowed three months
to settle their affairs before leaving.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Dutch dominion in Brazil. Four
provinces, three cities, eight towns, fourteen fortified
places, and three hundred leagues of coast were
definitely restored to the Portuguese Crown. A
gigantic commercial speculation had failed before
the obstinate resistance of a few farmers animated
by a love of country and religion. Twenty-five
years of bloody warfare or sulky acquiescence in
alien rule had welded the Portuguese colonists along
the Brazilian coast into a nation. Directly from the
Dutch they had learned little or nothing. Rather
were the traits which have ever since been the cause
of Brazil's industrial backwardness intensified.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the leaders in the Pernambuco
war of independence epitomise the races of
Brazil. Vidal is the type of a high-class Brazilian&mdash;generous,
jealous, spendthrift, proud, intelligent,
quick at expedients, and not too scrupulous in his
use of them. Camarr&atilde;o, the Indian, perished before
the final victory as if to show symbolically that
his race had not the stamina to hold out in competition
with white or black. Dias represents the
negro&mdash;unsurpassable in fidelity and personal courage,
and needing only leadership to show transcendent
military qualities.</p>

<p>John Fernandes was a curious mixture of the
medi&aelig;val and modern. His wealth did not make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
him cautious where his country was concerned; he
had been honoured with the intimate confidence of
those whom he fought; he was grave, silent, reserved,
strongest when others were most discouraged;
no feeling of vanity ever interfered with his
purposes; if another man could do a piece of work
better than he, he stepped aside; when success was
in sight he imperturbably let showier men have
the glory. Religious faith and feudal loyalty were
the mainsprings of his nature; nevertheless in war
he was cautious, indefatigable, and calculating. In
crises he struck like a sledge-hammer, though he
could wait patiently and uncomplainingly for an
opportunity. His was not a pride that disdains
artifices. He conspired secretly and subtly, and
with all his apparent moderation of character he
blindly and unreasoningly hated everything Protestant
and non-Portuguese. On the hill at Tabocas
his battle-cry was: "Portuguese! At the heretics!
God is with us!" When the Dutch made their last
desperate charge, and it seemed as if all was up with
his band of insurgents, he refused to flee, but stood
beside the crucifix, calling on the Virgin and the
saints, and exhorting his companions to die rather
than yield to the unbelievers. When the Dutch
gave back he fell on his knees and intoned a hymn.
With each new victory gained he vowed a church to
the Virgin. When desperate over the hesitation of
the Admiral in the last scene of the war, his final
argument, made in all sincerity, was that failure
to expel the Dutch meant exposing thousands of
Catholics to the temptation of denying their faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
by a renewal of the heretic rule, and that for himself,
rather than share the responsibility for the
murder of thousands of souls, he would lead his Brazilians
to certain death.</p>

<p>Relentless to his enemies, to his friends and dependents
he was kindness itself. It is related that
a Portuguese, landed with hardly clothes enough to
cover him, and seeking a protector, was directed to
Fernandes. The latter was mounting his horse
to go on a journey. To the man's offer of allegiance
and appeal for help, he answered: "I am
going to my house ten miles away and have no
leisure now to relieve you, but follow me thither on
foot. If you are too weak to walk, take this horse I
am on. If you are faithful you shall have support
as long as my means hold out; if they fail, and there
should be nothing else to eat, I will cut off a leg
and we will eat it together." This was said with so
grave a face and severe a manner that the poor
Portuguese thought he meant to repulse him. But
on inquiry he found that Fernandes rarely smiled
and that literally all that he had was at the service
of his adherents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>


<p>In 1621 the northern provinces, Cear&aacute;, Maranh&atilde;o,
and Par&aacute;, had been separated from the rest of
Brazil and erected into an independent government
called the State of Maranh&atilde;o. In Cear&aacute; the cattle-industry
flourished; around the beautiful bay of
Maranh&atilde;o the Azoreans multiplied their colonies.
Cotton, mandioc, and sugar were grown in large
quantities; the cotton manufacture soon became an
important industry. But the mysterious Amazon,
whose entrance was guarded by the town of Par&aacute;,
seemed most attractive of all. No civilised man
had penetrated its length since Orellana's adventurous
voyage of a century before. In 1638 Jacom&eacute;
Raymundo, an able Brazilian, temporarily acting as
governor of Par&aacute;, determined to explore the great
river. The expedition which he sent out found its
way up the windings of the multitudinous channels,
and after eight months reached the first Spanish
settlement in the east of Ecuador. The Spanish
authorities at Lima and Quito saw no particular
value in a route through a territory in which no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
gold or silver had been discovered, and which by
the Spanish policy could not be used for commerce.
But when, two years, later Portugal regained her independence
the expedition turned out to have been
of vast importance. The Portuguese had found the
practicable route into the great river valley; they
controlled the mouth of the stream; and though
the whole territory lay west of the Tordesillas line
Spain never asserted any effective claim to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conquest of the great interior
plateaux to the south was rapidly proceeding. The
wars with the Dutch rather stimulated than retarded
it, for, so long as the Dutch commanded the sea,
the widely separated provinces were obliged to communicate
by land, and the Indian routes became
better known to the Brazilians. Settlers driven
from the sugar plantations on the coast took up
cattle-raising in the interior of the northern provinces.
In the extreme South, as early as 1635 the
Paulistas had rooted out the Jesuit settlements from
the whole region of the Paran&aacute;. To the North they
traversed the S&atilde;o Francisco valley and the plateau
of Goyaz. Manoel Correa explored the latter region
in 1647, and in 1671 another Paulista, Domingos
Jorge, penetrated with a force of subject Indians
into the great treeless plains which extend beyond
the mountain ranges bounding the S&atilde;o Francisco
valley on the north. These plains are now the
state of Piauhy. At about the same time the cattle-raisers
who had established themselves on the lower
S&atilde;o Francisco in Bahia, crossed over into the same
territory of Piauhy.  Within a short time the In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>dians
were reduced to submission, and the cattle
ranges were extended over the plains of Piauhy,
southern Cear&aacute;, and the adjacent provinces. This
great conquest completed the junction of southern
and central Brazil with Maranh&atilde;o and Par&aacute;. Long
lines of land communication were established, and
over them travel was more frequent than would
seem likely. Piauhy and Cear&aacute; soon produced an
enormous surplus of cattle whose export into other
provinces brought about a revolution in the alimentation
of the coast Brazilians. The Indians along
the north-east coast were gradually incorporated,
destroyed, or pushed back, though it was not until
1699 that they were finally subdued in Rio Grande
do Norte. From this time dates the astonishing
development of the population of Cear&aacute;, who during
this century have furnished nearly all the labour for
the gathering of rubber.</p>

<p>In the South, settlements multiplied up and down
the coast from Rio until nearly the whole of the
present state was occupied. Rio and S&atilde;o Paulo
flourished with the profits of the clandestine trade
with the Spanish colonies. The Paulistas continued
to spread in every direction. By 1654 they
had occupied the headwaters of the Parahyba and
west as far as Soracaba.</p>

<p>During the period just following the expulsion of
the Dutch the Portuguese government was not able
to enforce its policy of commercial exclusivism.
Treaties with Holland and England gave the citizens
of those countries a right to trade with Brazil,
and the colonists kept up their commerce with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
Spanish possessions. Municipal charters were freely
granted to Brazilian towns, and the existing franchises
reformed according to the most liberal model
in Portugal&mdash;that of Porto. Brazilians were relieved
of the absurd feudal distinctions which exempted
nobles alone from liability to torture, and regulated
the clothes a man might wear. The extraordinary
rapidity of Brazil's increase in population and territory
during the middle of the seventeenth century
was largely due to comparative freedom from vexatious
restrictions and exactions&mdash;commercial and
governmental. By the end of the century there
were three-quarters of a million people in Brazil&mdash;a
fivefold increase in seventy years, in spite of the fact
that the most populous provinces had been the
scene of war for twenty-four years of that time.</p>

<p>But the Portuguese government lost little time in
returning to the old restrictive conditions. Since
the loss of the Indies, Brazil was Portugal's principal
source of wealth, and aristocracy and Court made
the most of the unhappy colony.</p>

<p>Navigation companies were chartered and given a
monopoly of all commerce&mdash;export and import.
The Jesuits renewed their efforts to gain control of
the Indians. In S&atilde;o Paulo they had no chance of
success, but in the North the celebrated Padre Antonio
Vieira, one of the greatest geniuses that Portugal
has ever produced, was given a free hand. He
nearly smothered the whites of Maranh&atilde;o and Par&aacute;
with a ring of missions, and his successors established
settlements on the Amazon which finally
spread so as to communicate with the Spanish mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>sions
in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The Brazilians
of Maranh&atilde;o and Par&aacute; did not object to the occupation
of the valley of the Amazon, but they bitterly
resented the Jesuit encroachments in their own
neighbourhood. In 1684 a rebellion finally broke
out in Maranh&atilde;o under the leadership of Manoel
Beckman. He paid the forfeit with his life, but his
work had warned the Portuguese authorities that
they must not push their favours to the Jesuits too
far.</p>

<p>During the long Dutch war many Pernambucan
negroes had fled into the interior, where they had
established themselves in independent communities
and refused to recognise white supremacy. They
fortified their villages with palisades, obtained wives
by raids on the plantations, elected chiefs, devised
rude forms of administering justice, and adopted a
religion which was a mixture of the nature worship
of their African ancestors with the outward forms of
Christianity. In spite of numerous efforts to destroy
them, these strange republics lasted fifty years.
It was not until 1697 that a Paulista chief, Domingos
Jorge, who was employed after the regulars had
failed, succeeded in shutting the negroes up in their
great palisade at Palmares. Seven thousand men
took part in the assault, and of the ten thousand
negroes who defended it none were spared.</p>

<p>This was the only serious attempt at revolt on the
part of the blacks which ever occurred in Brazil.
Except for a few easily suppressed insurrections
which mostly occurred in Bahia among the recent
arrivals, the negroes remained in abject submission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
until nearly the end of the nineteenth century.
The comparative mildness of the Brazilian treatment
of negroes, the practice of voluntary manumission,
and the fact that no impenetrable race barrier existed
all contributed to make slavery a less fearful thing in
Brazil than in North America.</p>

<p>Both Spain and Portugal claimed the coast between
Santos and the river Plate under the treaty of
Tordesillas, but neither nation had made any serious
attempt to take possession up to the end of the
seventeenth century. As a matter of fact, the Tordesillas
line passed near the southern boundary of
the Brazilian state of S&atilde;o Paulo, but the Portuguese
maps pushed all Brazil eight degrees to the east, and
Portugal claimed that the line passed near the point
where the Paran&aacute; and Uruguay unite to form the
Plate. The Paulistas had made this claim effective
over much of the disputed territory.</p>

<p>For a century after the foundation of Buenos
Aires the Spaniards failed to occupy the north margin
of the Plate, and in 1680 the Portuguese fore-stalled
them by founding a colony and fort, called
Colonia, directly opposite Buenos Aires. The
Spanish governor promptly resented this piece of
audacity and captured the place, but was compelled
to restore it immediately by orders from Madrid.
Louis XIV., who was then arbiter of Europe, had
no mind to allow a war to be precipitated over so
insignificant a matter as a post in an uninhabited
part of South America. However, the question of
right to the territory was left open for future determination.
Colonia at that time was chiefly valued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
as an <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for clandestine trade with the Spanish
provinces, but to its existence can be traced Brazilian
possession of the great states of Paran&aacute;, Santa
Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sul, and even Brazil's
dominance in the Upper Paran&aacute; valley, a dominance
which would have been lost had Spain insisted upon
the true Tordesillas line.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>GOLD DISCOVERIES&mdash;REVOLTS&mdash;FRENCH ATTACKS</h3>


<p>The early attempts to find gold and silver had
not been successful. A little gold was found
in S&atilde;o Paulo in the sixteenth century, but no great
discoveries were made until nearly the end of the
seventeenth. The Paulistas, who scoured the interior
in their slave-hunts, occasionally came across indications
of gold, and rumours constantly reached the
coast. But for a long time the Paulistas failed,
either through ignorance or design, to give sufficiently
exact information. After 1670 the rumours
became so circumstantial that no doubt was felt that
the mountain ranges around the headwaters of the
S&atilde;o Francisco River were gold-bearing. Stimulated
by government promises of liberal treatment, the
Paulistas undertook the hunt in earnest. About
1690 they found the rich gold washings of Sabar&aacute;,
where to-day is one of the great mines of the world&mdash;the
Morro Velho. This is three hundred miles
directly north of Rio. In 1693, Antonio Arz&atilde;o, a
Paulista, penetrated west from this region to the
seacoast at Victoria, bringing with him native gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
in large nuggets. These were sent to Portugal and
created intense excitement. The Paulistas followed
up these first discoveries by soon finding half a
dozen other fields&mdash;all of them yielding gold in
abundance to the crudest processes. A rush started
that threatened to depopulate the seacoast and
even Portugal itself. The find was the greatest gold
discovery which had been made in the history of the
world up to that time. The one province of Minas
Geraes produced seven million five hundred thousand
ounces within the first fifty years, and its total
product to the present time has been twenty-five
million ounces.</p>

<p>The Paulista discoverers of the mines soon became
involved in quarrels with the swarms of adventurers
who poured in from Portugal. The government at
first did not establish any regular control over the
mining region, and disputes arose between the old
and new comers as to proprietorship of claims.
Anarchy and civil war ensued, but the foreign element,
nicknamed the "emboabas," came out on top
with a strong man, Nunes Vianna, at the head of
affairs. He became the virtual ruler of the region,
and the Portuguese authorities at Rio, seeing their
perquisites endangered, tried to get rid of him by
force. They were unsuccessful, but finally managed
to seduce his followers and secure a recognition of
their own paramount authority by solemn promises
to concede the reasonable demands of the miners.
These promises were not kept. Vianna, though he
had been induced to surrender on assurances that
his life would be spared, was assassinated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>The mining laws, at first liberal, were narrowed
until exploration was discouraged and production
oppressed. For years the authorities tried to collect
a fixed amount for each slave employed&mdash;a provision
which discouraged searches for new deposits.
Then the system of requiring all gold to be taken to
government melting-houses was enforced. Export
in dust or nuggets was forbidden, and no gold was
allowed in circulation except that which bore the
government stamp showing it had paid the king's
fifth. This involved the searching of every traveller's
pockets and the posting of detachments of soldiers
at every crossroads. So oppressive and inconvenient
was this that finally the chief miners and municipal
authorities agreed to be responsible for a lump sum
yearly.</p>

<p>The war of the emboabas ended in 1709, but
troubles broke out in the mining regions from time
to time down to the end of the colonial period.
These struggles for local self-government&mdash;for the
right to exist&mdash;were not confined to Minas. In
various forms and at various times they were repeated
in most of the provinces, and a strong belief
in local autonomy never died out, though for long
periods it was apparently crushed out of existence.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the overthrow of the semi-independent
government of Minas, which had been
set up by the emboabas, a civil war broke out in the
old province of Pernambuco. This was a struggle
of the oligarchy of native Brazilian sugar-planters
against the rigorous and corrupt rule of the royal
governors and against the encroachments of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
newly arrived Portuguese. Then, as now, foreigners
conducted the trade of Brazil; the Brazilian aristocrats
remained on their plantations, disdaining the
small economies and anxieties of commerce. The
Portuguese were the peddlers, shopkeepers, and
money-lenders for the community, as well as the
officials of the government. In both capacities
they pressed hard on the extravagant Brazilians.
Olinda, the old capital, was the headquarters of the
latter. Recife, three miles south, was the port and
chiefly inhabited by native Portuguese. It had outrun
Olinda during the Dutch occupation, but was
legally only an administrative dependency of the
older and smaller town. In 1709 the Portuguese
government made Recife a separate city&mdash;a step
which was bitterly resented by the Brazilians and
especially by the close corporation of native families
who controlled the Olinda municipal government.
Hostilities broke out between them and the governor.
Two thousand Pernambucanos invaded Recife;
the troops deserted and the governor fled for
his life, while the royal charter to Recife was torn
to bits by the mob. The heads of the insurrection
met to determine what form of government should
be adopted. Bernardo Vieira, the best soldier in
the colony, proposed that a republic should be
founded on the plan of Venice, probably the first
time a republic was ever advocated on American soil.
The proposition met with much favour, but the conservatives
shrank from so radical a departure. The
bishop was made acting-governor, but his hand
proved not firm enough to control the divergent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
interests and ambitions. The Portuguese&mdash;"mascates"
they were called&mdash;revolted in their turn and
drove him from Recife. The Pernambucanos besieged
the place, but the loss of the seaport was a
heavy blow. The Olinda oligarchy was not able to
secure the co-operation of the smaller municipalities,
and civil war spread throughout the province.
When a new governor appeared with a commission
from the king, he had little difficulty, by promises
of fair treatment, in inducing all parties to lay down
their arms. No sooner, however, was he safely in
power than he imprisoned and banished the chiefs
of the revolt, especially selecting those who had
favoured an independent republic.</p>

<p>All three great revolts&mdash;Beckman's in Maranh&atilde;o,
that of the emboabas in Minas, and the Olinda rebellion
of 1710&mdash;followed substantially the same
course. Local feeling was strong enough to sweep
all before it for a time, but lack of capacity for organisation,
intestine quarrels, want of persistency,
soon enabled the Portuguese officials to re-establish
themselves more firmly than ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Portugal had become involved in the
War of the Spanish Succession. Colonia was again
captured by the Spanish of Buenos Aires, and
though it was restored at the end of the war its
trade was never so prosperous afterwards. In the
Upper Amazon Spanish Jesuits had come down
from Quito, but the Portuguese expelled them,
thereby confirming Portugal's title as far as the
foothills of the Andes. The Spaniards of the
eighteenth century no more than the Peruvians and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Bolivians of the nineteenth were able to cope with
the difficulties of transit from the Pacific side of the
mountains. Portugal's effective possession reached
to the 70th meridian from Greenwich&mdash;sixteen hundred
miles west of the Tordesillas line.</p>

<p>Rio was the only important Brazilian port which
had escaped attack by hostile fleets during the preceding
century, and the discovery of the gold mines
gave a tremendous impetus to its prosperity and
wealth. The only gateway to the mining territory,
its population of over twelve thousand was soon one
of the richest and busiest in all America. The opportunity
was too tempting to be neglected by the
French prize-hunters. A daring Frenchman, named
Duclerc, appeared before the city in 1710, but, seeing
that he had not ships strong enough to force the
entrance, landed with a thousand marines forty miles
down the coast. They met with no resistance in
their march through the woods and arrived back
of the city without loss. Thence they proceeded
coolly to charge into the narrow streets in the face
of the artillery fire from the hilltop forts that surround
the city. The audacious enterprise was very
nearly successful. The Portuguese regulars offered
no effective resistance, and the main body of the
French penetrated to the very centre of the city.
There they were checked by a little party of students
who had climbed into the governor's palace and were
firing out of the windows. The French finally took
the palace by assault, but meanwhile the city had
risen behind them, their scattered detachments were
massacred in detail, and the main body in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
palace had to surrender at discretion. The Portuguese
sullied their victory by acts of medi&aelig;val
cruelty&mdash;killing most of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The victims did not long remain unavenged. As
soon as the news reached France, Admiral Duguay-Trouin,
one of the ablest seamen his nation has
produced, volunteered to lead an expedition to Rio.
Wealthy merchants of St. Malo supplied the money,
and in June, 1711, he sailed with seven line-of-battle
ships, six frigates, and four smaller vessels, manned
by five thousand picked men. Secretly as the
expedition had been despatched, the Portuguese
had received warning. The garrison had been re-enforced
and the narrow-mouthed harbour and hill-commanded
city were defended by three forts and
eleven batteries, besides four ships of the line and
four frigates. Favoured by a foggy morning he ran
boldly in, suffering little loss. Of the Portuguese
men-of-war not one escaped. Fort Villegagnon was
blown up by the mismanagement of its garrison, the
Portuguese became demoralised, Trouin put a battery
on an unoccupied island within cannon-shot of
the city, and disembarked troops to the left of the
town where a range of hills made it easy to dominate
the low ground. The poor governor knew no
better tactics than to let the French enter the
streets and then overpower them in fighting from
the houses. But Trouin was too old a soldier to
be caught like his fellow-countrymen the year before.
He coolly advanced his batteries and soon
had the town commanded on three sides; it was
only a question of getting his cannon into position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
when he could batter the place at his leisure. Panic
extended from the citizens to the soldiers, and a
week after the French had entered the harbour the
governor fled ignominiously to the interior, and the
French took possession unopposed.</p>

<p>Revenge and plunder had been the objects of the
expedition. It would have been very difficult for the
French to have remained in permanent possession
of the city, and a conquest of the interior, with its
large population and mountainous character, was not
to be thought of. The city was admitted to ransom
on giving up the surviving prisoners of the Duclerc
expedition. Duguay-Trouin sailed triumphantly
back to France with a treasure which netted the
Norman merchants who had fitted him out ninety-two
per cent. on their investment, in spite of the
wrecking of the biggest ship on the homeward voyage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>


<p>Montevideo was founded in 1726 and became
the nucleus of the Spanish settlements
which have grown into the modern country of Uruguay.
Except Colonia, the only Portuguese settlements
south of the 25th degree were the town of
Santa Catharina Island, the unimportant village of
Laguna on the coast-plain, and the scattered ranches
of a few adventurous Paulistas on the plateau.</p>

<p>The founding of Montevideo drew the serious attention
of the Rio government to the valuable country
between the Plate and Santa Catharina. The
Paulistas had thoroughly explored the plains and
found them swarming with cattle. The chief obstacle
to the foundation of a military post as a nucleus
for the settlement of Rio Grande and eastern Uruguay
was the lack of a harbour on that sandy coast.
When the next European war broke out, in 1735,
the Spaniards again besieged Colonia, and established
forts and settlements along the Uruguayan
coast, from Montevideo to the present Brazilian border.
In 1737, the Portuguese authorities sent an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
expedition to take Montevideo, which failed. On
the way back the Portuguese built a little fort at the
only entrance which gives access to the great series
of lagoons which run parallel to the coast for two
hundred and fifty miles north of the southern Brazilian
frontier. This is the site of the present city of
Rio Grande do Sul. A few years later, a considerable
number of settlers from the Azores Islands were
introduced, who engaged in agriculture along the
fertile borders of the great Duck Lagoon.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1750, Spain and Portugal made an attempt to
reach an amicable and rational agreement about
their South American boundaries. Up to that time,
Spain had stubbornly claimed the territory as far
north and east as Santos, and Portugal was even
more unreasonable in asserting her exclusive right
to the coast as far south and west as the mouth of
the Uruguay. The treaty of 1750 virtually recognised
the <i>uti possidetis</i>. Portugal agreed to give up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
Colonia, and the boundary to her possessions and
those of Spain was drawn between the Spanish settlements
in Uruguay and the Portuguese settlements
in Rio Grande. The seven Jesuit missions in the
interior, two hundred miles to the north, were
abandoned by the Spanish government. Spain deliberately
ceded these tens of thousands of peaceful
and prosperous civilised Indians, and even agreed
that her troops should assist the Portuguese in the
cruel dispossession. The Indians fought desperately
and unavailingly. But this iniquitous provision of
the treaty was the only part of it which was ever carried
into effect. Spanish public opinion protested,
the boundary commissions could not agree, Portugal
put off the surrender of Colonia on one pretext or
another, and in 1761 the treaty fell to the ground
and all the questions were left open.</p>

<p>That year Spain and Portugal became embroiled
on opposite sides in the Seven Years' War, and the
Spaniards from Buenos Aires invaded the disputed
territory in overwhelming force. Colonia was taken
and in 1763 the Spanish governor led his army
against the Portuguese settlements in Rio Grande.
The fortified town of Rio Grande fell, the superior
Argentine cavalry drove the Rio Grandenses back
to the coast, and the Portuguese territory was reduced
to the north-east quarter of the state. The
flourishing farms of the Azorean settlers were laid
waste, and from this invasion dates the adoption by
the Rio Grandenses of pastoral habits. The Treaty
of Paris put an end to the war in Europe. The
Spaniards ceased their advance, they restored Co<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>lonia
once more, but retained their conquests in
southern Rio Grande.</p>

<p>The Rio Grandenses made good use of the breathing-spell.
They cared little whether there was peace
or war in Europe, and four years later made a desperate
effort to recapture their old capital and regain
their farms in the south. Disavowed by their
government, they still kept on fighting; soon they
made a regular business of raiding the territory occupied
by the Spaniards; the beef they found on
the plains was their food; they were always in the
saddle and soon became the finest of irregular cavalry
and partisan fighters.</p>

<p>The Spaniards retaliated by invading northern
Rio Grande, but never succeeded in routing the Rio
Grandenses from their last strongholds. In 1775 the
Brazilians were re-enforced from S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio
and took the aggressive, and the following year
recaptured the city of Rio Grande. The Spanish
government took prompt steps to avenge this loss.
A great fleet was sent out, Santa Catharina was captured,
an army of four thousand men was on the
march up from Montevideo to sweep the Portuguese
out of all southern Brazil once and for all. But in
this crisis European politics again saved Brazil from
dismemberment. France and Spain were forming
a coalition against England in the War of American
Independence. Spain wished to have her hands
free and to isolate England. The Spanish fleet and
army were at the gates of Rio Grande when the
Treaty of San Ildefonso was signed in 1777. The
Portuguese definitely relinquished Colonia; Uruguay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
and the Seven Missions remained Spanish, but most
of southern Rio Grande which the Portuguese had
lost in 1763, as well as Santa Catharina, was restored
to them.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD RANCH IN RIO GRANDE.</span>
</div>

<p>The thirty-four years of peace which followed in
Rio Grande were employed in steady growth. A
craze for cattle-raising set in, and the plains were divided
up into great <i>estancias</i> which were distributed
among the governor's favourites or those who had
distinguished themselves during the war. Substantially
the entire population engaged in the cattle
business. The Rio Grandenses and their cattle
multiplied so rapidly that they spread out over the
western part of the state, which was still Spanish, and
to the south. In 1780 the curing of beef by drying
and salting was introduced, which permitted its shipment,
and afforded a stable market.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 777px;">
<img src="images/illus-411.jpg" width="777" height="600" alt="WASHING DIAMONDS." title="" />
<span class="caption">WASHING DIAMONDS.</span>
</div>

<p>After the great gold discoveries in Minas during
the late years of the seventeenth and early years of
the eighteenth centuries, the prospectors ranged
north from Sabar&aacute; along the great Backbone Mountains,
finding washings at many places in North
Minas and Bahia. By 1740 the fields in Bahia were
producing fifty to a hundred thousand ounces a year.
As early as 1718 an expedition had penetrated fifteen
hundred miles to the west and discovered good
placers on the plateau where the headwaters of the
Madeira and the Paraguay intertwine. This was
the beginning of Cuyab&aacute; and the state of Matto
Grosso. In ten years a million five hundred thous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>and
ounces were taken out from these diggings. A
little later still other fields were discovered farther
west on the Madeira watershed.</p>

<p>The miners at the gold camp of Tijuca in North
Minas had noticed some curious little shining stones
in the bottom of their pans and thought them so
pretty that they used them for counters in games.
Soon a wandering friar who had been in India recognised
them as diamonds. This occurred in 1729,
and the field thus opened up supplied the world
with diamonds until the discovery of Kimberley.
In the years from 1730 to 1770 five million carats
were taken from the original Diamantina district,
and the deposits are still second in productiveness
only to those of South Africa. The diamond region
was at once declared Crown property and a deadline
drawn around it which none except officials
were allowed to cross.</p>

<p>In 1716 an exploring expedition ascended the
Madeira, and in the years following the Tocantins,
the Araguaya, the Rio Negro, and the principal
tributaries of the Upper Amazon were navigated.
The Jesuit settlements in the Amazon valley continued
to flourish. While the interior and the South
were expanding rapidly, the coast provinces were
relatively declining. The growing competition of
the West Indies reduced the price of sugar. During
the seventeenth century Brazil had furnished the
bulk of European sugar consumption, selling her
product at non-competitive prices. But the growth
of the English and Dutch colonial empires brought
into the field competitors who possessed as good a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
climate and soil and enjoyed the inestimable advantage
of better government. Portugal's vicious and
narrow-minded colonial system was not changed
until Brazil's competitors had so far passed her that
she has never since been able to make up lost
ground.</p>

<p>The wealth from mines and taxes that Brazil
poured into the Portuguese treasury was squandered
by the dissipated bigot, John V. When he died in
1750 he left Portugal in a bad way, and though Brazil
had managed to grow in spite of mismanagement,
the outlook was discouraging. The Spaniards were
threatening the new settlements in the South; S&atilde;o
Paulo had been depopulated by the migration to the
mines; Bahia's and Pernambuco's sugar and tobacco
industries were decadent; in Cear&aacute; and Piauhy the
golden days of the cattle business had passed; Maranh&atilde;o
and Par&aacute; had stopped short in their development,
and their spread into the interior had been cut
off by the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Contemporary documents prove the horrible corruption.
From ministers of State down to the
humblest subordinate every official had his share in
the pickings. The farmers of the revenues openly
paid bribes and might exact what they pleased from
the taxpayers. All trade except that with Portugal
was forbidden, and this was hampered in a hundred
ways. Salt, wine, soap, rum, tobacco, olive oil, and
hides were monopolies. All legal transactions were
burdened with heavy fees; slaves paid so much a
head; every river on a road was the occasion for a
new toll; the exercise of professions and trades was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
forbidden except on the payment of heavy fees;
anything that could compete with Portugal was
prohibited altogether. Taxation shut off industrial
enterprise at its very sources, and many of the worst
features of the system then put in vogue have never
been discontinued.</p>

<p>The governors and military commanders interfered
constantly with the administration of justice
in favour of their friends and favourites; they accepted
bribes for allowing contraband trade and
permitting the immigration of foreigners; they misappropriated
the funds of widows and orphans; they
ignored the franchises of the municipalities; they
imposed unauthorised taxes; they forced loans from
suitors having claims before them; they obliged free
men to work without pay; they forcibly took wives
away from their husbands; they impressed the
young men for the wars on the Spanish border,
required every able bodied man to serve in the militia,
and commonly practised arbitrary imprisonment.
How even one of the best of them interfered to regulate
private affairs can best be shown by his own
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I promoted the good of the people by forcibly compelling
them to plant maize and pulse, and threatening
to take away their lands altogether if they did not cultivate
them diligently; I required the militia colonels to
make exact reports about this matter and thus brought
about a great increase in the production of food crops
and sugar. I called the militia together for exercise on
Sundays and holidays, days which otherwise the people
would have spent in idleness and pleasure. Many have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>complained, but I have never given their complaints the
slightest attention, having always followed the system of
taking no notice whatever of the people's murmurs."</p></div>

</div>

<p>He describes the Brazilians as vain, but indolent
and easily subdued; robust and supporting labour
well, but inclined to an inaction from which only
extreme poverty or the command of their superiors
could rouse them. They had no education, for the
only schools were a few Jesuit seminaries, and no
printing-press existed. They were licentious, had
no aristocracy, were unaccustomed to social subordination,
and would obey no authority except
the military.</p>

<p>Underneath the surface fermented a deep disgust.
Even in the seaports the very name of government
was hated, and in the interior the people withdrew
themselves as much as possible from contact or participation
with it. A dull hatred of Portugal and
Portuguese spread among all classes of natives. In
much of the country the only law was the patriarchal
influence of the heads of the landed families, who
often exercised powers of life and death. Instances
are on record where fathers ordered their sons to kill
their own sisters when the latter had dishonoured
the family name.</p>

<p>With the death of John V. in 1750 the great Marquis
of Pombal became prime minister. The enormous
energy and activity of this remarkable man
revolutionised the administration of Portugal and
Brazil. Official corruption was severely punished;
order replaced confusion; agriculture, industry, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
commerce were protected and encouraged. In spite
of the threatened exhaustion of the placers mining
flourished. Maranh&atilde;o and Par&aacute; took a new start;
the worst monopolies were abolished; the price of
sugar rose with the great colonial wars and the
adoption of reasonable regulations. Wealth and
revenues increased apace and peace and security
were self-guarded. When Pombal fell, after twenty-seven
years in power, Brazil's population had risen
to two millions; Rio was a city of fifty thousand
and the capital had been transferred there; Bahia
had forty thousand; Minas contained four hundred
thousand people; the yield of gold was four hundred
thousand carats yearly, and the diamond production
one hundred and fifty thousand carats, and,
finally, Santa Catharina and Rio Grande had been
saved from the Spaniards and settled. Pombal had
made short work of the Jesuits. In 1755 he took
away their rights over their Indians, and four years
later issued an order for their immediate and unconditional
expulsion and the confiscation of their
property.</p>

<p>Pombal had no favourites; he spared no individuals
and no classes in his work of ruthlessly concentrating
all power in the Crown. But he built a
Frankenstein of which he himself was the helpless
victim the moment his old master died. Unwittingly
he prepared the way for the triumph of the
ideas of the French Revolution both in Portugal
and Brazil, and his most beneficent measures were
the most fatal to the permanence of his despotic
system.  Commercial prosperity gave the Brazilian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
people resources; the impartial administration of
law gave them some conceptions of civic pride and
independence; the encouragement of education,
small as it was, helped start an intellectual movement
which spread over the wilds of Brazil the
liberal principle then fermenting in Europe.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his fall in 1777 the Portuguese
government reverted to most of the old abuses, but
the economic impulse did not at once die out.</p>

<p>Pombal had not only expelled the Jesuits, but
had taken effective measures against enslaving the
Indians. The latter separated themselves from the
whites, and miscegenation largely decreased. On
the other hand, the importation of negro slaves had
been continued on a large scale throughout the
eighteenth century and the proportion of blacks in
the mining and sugar districts had increased. Intermixture
with negroes was stimulated by the seclusion
of the white women. The young men often took
mistresses from among the slaves, and these unions
sometimes subsisted after legitimate marriage. The
system of double <i>m&eacute;nages</i>, however, decreased as
manners became more liberal, and opportunities for
social intercourse between the sexes increased.</p>

<p>The more energetic Brazilians acquired the rudiments
of learning in the Jesuit schools, and a few
fortunate youths were sent to the University at
Coimbra in Portugal. In the early decades of the
eighteenth century societies for the discussion of
literary and scientific questions were established in
Rio and Bahia. In the centres of population little
groups of scholars began to gather who surrepti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>tiously
obtained the writings of French and English
political philosophers. Suddenly, in the latter half
of the century, a dazzling literary outburst occurred.
Its seat was not in Rio, the political, nor Bahia,
the ecclesiastical capital, nor yet in Pernambuco, the
cradle of the nationality, but in Ouro Preto, the
chief place of the mining province of Minas, twenty
days' journey on muleback from the coast, and
among a rude and unlettered population. Within a
few years appeared six of the foremost poets of the
Portuguese language: the lyrics, Gonzaga, Claudio,
Silva Alvarengo, and Alvarengo Peixoto, and the
epics, Basilio da Gama and Santa Rita Dur&atilde;o. He
who writes the songs of a people rather records their
history than influences it. The writings of the Minas
lyric poets are the best documents extant on the
character of the Brazilians of the colonial period.
They clearly reveal that culture was only at its beginnings;
that patriotism and national pride were
indefinite and shadowy; that religion was neither
dogmatic nor absorbing; that polite society had not
come into being, and that the intellectual element
entered little into the relations of the sexes.</p>

<p>The independence of the United States suggested
to a few Brazilians the possibility of freeing their
country from Portugal. In 1785 a dozen Brazilian
students at Coimbra formed a club for this purpose,
and one of them wrote to Thomas Jefferson, then
Minister to France, asking American aid. Jefferson
was interested, but answered that nothing could be
done until the Brazilians themselves had risen in
arms. A like impulse was working in the minds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the poets and their friends at Ouro Preto. A child-like
conspiracy was formed whose object was to
found a republic with San John d'El Rei as capital
and Ouro Preto as the seat of a university. A few
practical men listened to the plans of the conspirators
probably with a view of turning a disturbance
to account in preventing the government from putting
into effect an obnoxious gold tax then being
threatened. Among those let into the inner circle
was a young sergeant nicknamed "Tiradentes."
He undertook the task of fomenting an uprising
among the troops, but before anything practical
had been done the whole thing had been given
away to the authorities. The conspirators were
arrested and taken to Rio, where the frightened
governor instituted a formal and elaborate trial and
took a fearful vengeance upon the helpless boys and
poets. Poor Tiradentes, being without powerful
connections, was hanged and quartered. His memory
is now revered in Brazil as that of the first
martyr to independence and the precursor of the
republic. The gentle Claudio hanged himself in
prison after having been tortured into a confession
implicating his friends. Gonzaga and Alvarengo,
with several others, were banished to Africa.</p>

<p>Republican and separatist ideas had, however,
made no headway among the Brazilian masses.
Brazil's independence was to come by the force of
circumstances and not by any deliberate national
effort, and for a republic she was destined to wait a
century more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE PORTUGUESE COURT IN RIO</h3>


<p>The political development of colonial Brazil may
be divided into three epochs. First, there was
the confusion of early colonisation, the unsuccessful
attempt to establish a system of feudal captaincies,
the struggles against the Indians, French, and
Jesuits, and the search for a solid economic foundation
for the new commonwealth. On the whole,
this era contained the promise of the ultimate development
of a freer governmental system than that
of Portugal.</p>

<p>Next followed the Spanish dynasty and the wars
against the Dutch. Control of Brazil by the home
government was weakened, and the colonists learned
their own military power. The years following the
expulsion of the Dutch&mdash;1655 to 1700&mdash;were the
brightest politically in Brazil's colonial history.
The municipalities, governed by local oligarchies of
landowners, exercised functions not contemplated
by the Portuguese code. Though the military governors
were continually encroaching, and the system
was imperfect, it was in essence thoroughly local.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Its fundamental defect was the want of co-operation
between the towns.</p>

<p>The third period began with the consolidation of
Portugal's international position in the closing years
of the seventeenth century. Once secure from
foreign attacks, she renewed the exploitation of
Brazil with redoubled eagerness. The discovery of
the mines made the plunder enormous. At first
there were resistance and even formidable rebellions
like Beckman's in Maranh&atilde;o, of the mascates in
Pernambuco, or of the emboabas in Minas. But
the civic vitality of the people was not great enough
to sustain any continuous and effective opposition.
Early in the eighteenth century the municipalities
were already at the mercy of the military governors,
and Brazil was governed partly by petty despots and
partly by numerous feeble local bodies who were
without cohesion or power to resist interference.
Brazil would have remained a dependency of Portugal
during an indefinite period had it not been for a
series of events which arose in Europe out of the
French Revolution.</p>

</div>

<p>By 1807 England was the only power which still
defied Napoleon. Portugal had been Great Britain's
ally for a century, but Napoleon found it necessary
to have command of Lisbon and Porto in order to
enforce his Berlin and Milan decrees. He peremptorily
commanded Portugal to give up her English
alliance. The pusillanimous John, who had been
prince regent since the insanity of his mother in
1792, hesitated and shuffled, seeking to put off the
emperor with negotiations and evasions and a show
of hostility to England. A single despatch indicating
his double dealing was enough for Napoleon,
who promptly made an agreement with Spain for the
division of Portugal and ordered Junot to march on
Lisbon. The people were ready to make a desperate
resistance, but their king was in two minds each
day, and the army had been withdrawn from the
frontier to bid the British fleet a hypocritical defiance.
John shed tears over his unhappy country,
but prepared to save his own person by a flight to
Rio. Junot had passed the frontier and was advancing
on Lisbon by forced marches. The Prince
Regent and his Court huddled their movable property
on board the men-of-war lying in the Tagus.
Fifteen thousand persons, including most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
nobility, and fifty millions of property and treasure
were embarked. Junot's advance guard arrived at
the mouth of the river on the 27th of November,
1807, in time to see the fleet just outside and bearing
south under British convoy.</p>

<p>Six weeks later the exiles caught sight of the coast
of Brazil, destined thereafter to be the principal seat
of the Portuguese race. The Prince Regent disembarked
at Bahia, where the people received him
with enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty and tried
desperately hard to induce him to make their city
his capital. He adhered to the original plan, and
on the 7th of March, 1808, arrived at Rio, where he
was received with equal cordiality. No conditions
were imposed on the helpless fugitives. The first
acts of the prince regent proved that the removal
would be of inestimable advantage to Brazil. He
promulgated a decree opening the five great ports to
the commerce of all friendly nations. The system
of seclusion and monopolies fell to the ground at a
single blow. Other decrees removed the prohibitions
on manufacturing and on trades. Foreigners
were allowed to come to Brazil either for travel
or residence, and were guaranteed personal and
property rights; a national bank was established;
commercial corporations were given franchises; a
printing-press was set up; military and naval schools
and a medical college were founded. Foreigners
were encouraged to immigrate and that improvement
in art, industries, civilisation, and manners began
which can only result from the daily contact of different
types of humanity.  For the first time Brazil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
was opened to scientific investigation, and scholars,
engineers, and artists were imported to aid in making
its resources known. The commercial nations lost
no time in trying to get a foothold in this virgin
market; they sent their consuls and salesmen, and
within a few months importations, principally from
Great Britain, far exceeded any possible demand.</p>

<p>The prince regent found his South American
empire divided into eighteen provinces. These
constitute the present states of the Brazilian union&mdash;the
only changes having been the separation of
Alagoas from Pernambuco and of Paran&aacute; from S&atilde;o
Paulo, besides the erection of the city of Rio into a
neutral district. Of the three millions of people
one-third were negro slaves, and the free negroes and
mulattos numbered as many more. The proportion
of whites in the whole country was not more
than a fourth, and in the larger coast cities, in the
sugar districts, and the mining regions, it descended
to a seventh and even a tenth. Civilised Indians
were most numerous in Par&aacute; and Amazonas, and
whites predominated most in the extreme South and
in the stock-raising interior. In the century since,
the whites have increased to forty per cent. and the
negroes have fallen to less than twenty-five, in spite
of the large slave importation in the first half of the
nineteenth century. Sugar was still the great staple.
Exports of gold and precious stones had fallen with
the exhaustion of the best placers late in the preceding
century. Tobacco was largely produced,
especially in Bahia, and Maranh&atilde;o and Par&aacute; were
centres of a flourishing cotton trade. Rice, indigo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
and pepper were exported on a considerable scale,
and the production of coffee had been carried from
Par&aacute; to Rio, and was rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>The people of the interior were mostly clothed in
coarse cottons manufactured at home; probably
nine-tenths went barefoot and lived in rude houses
without ornamentation and conveniences. The slave
system, the large landed estates, the want of diversification
of industry, the general apathy, the ease of
maintaining one's self in the mild climate&mdash;all these
causes co-operated to lessen consuming power and
to diminish Brazil's value as a market for imported
merchandise.</p>

<p>Great estates, many of them owned by religious
corporations, were the rule. Only the best parts
of these estates were cultivated. Enclosures were
almost unknown, and the farm buildings were dilapidated.
Though next to sugar the chief wealth,
cattle were neglected, breeds were not kept up, and
the making of butter was so little understood that
it was worth a dollar a pound. The proprietors of
the sugar ranches left everything to their slaves.
Ploughs were unknown; lumber was sawed by hand;
water power was rarely used for any purpose, though
so abundant. The only schools were a few in the
towns; artificial light was practically unused; the
cities were dilapidated, and their filthy streets were
full of stagnant water. Horsemen rode on the sidewalks
in the centre of Rio itself.</p>

<p>Freight was brought from the interior on muleback
over narrow trails, and hardly any roads for
wheeled vehicles existed. The mountains and heav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>ily
forested coast regions were extremely difficult to
penetrate, but in the sparsely forested interior the
old Indian trails furnished facilities for constant communication,
which was astonishingly rapid considering
the circumstances.</p>

<p>The people were very hospitable; to receive a
guest was an honour; each ranch had special quarters
for travellers, and the only pay the stranger
could offer was to tell the news. Outside the ports
no foreigner had ever been seen, and the first Englishman
who visited S&atilde;o Paulo in 1809 was as much
of a curiosity as an Esquimau would be to-day.</p>

<p>During John's stay in Rio, Brazil was little involved
in foreign difficulties. In 1808 an expedition
was sent from Par&aacute;, which took possession of Cayenne,
but the place was restored to the French in
1815. In the south the breaking out of the Argentine
revolution in 1810 was a temptation for the
Prince Regent to increase Brazil's territory. After
the expulsion of the Spaniards by the populace of
Buenos Aires, the Spanish forces in Montevideo
held that place against the patriots for four years.
John sent an army into Uruguay in 1811 nominally
to help the Spaniards, but he had to withdraw it
because of British pressure. After the surrender of
Montevideo by the Spaniards a civil war broke out
amongst the patriots of Uruguay and the adjacent
Argentine provinces. The warring factions trespassed
on the territory of their Brazilian neighbours.
John determined to seize the coveted north bank of
the Plate for himself. In 1815 the celebrated guerrilla
chief, Artigas, invaded the Seven Missions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
which had been seized in 1801, and throughout that
year and the next the Rio Grandenses fought desperately
to expel him. Finally Artigas was decisively
defeated, and the Portuguese army marched
down the coast and entered Montevideo without
opposition. They were welcomed by the factions
opposed to Artigas, but the Buenos Aires government
protested and Artigas kept up a resistance in
the interior until he was overthrown by rival Argentine
chieftains. From 1817 to 1821 Uruguay
remained in the military occupation of Brazilian
troops, and in the latter year it was formally annexed
under the title of the Cisplatine Province.</p>

<p>Brazil had had to assume the burdens as well as
reap the advantages of being an independent nation.
The whole extravagant government with its swarm
of hangers-on, who had bankrupted both nations
together, was now saddled on Brazil alone. John's
advisers regarded liberal principles as dangerous to
civil order, and considered all French and North
Americans as firebrands whose presence in Brazil
might start the flame of revolution. The United
States minister was treated as if he were a Jacobin
agent, and American ships were searched for Napoleon's
spies. However, the removal of the Court to
Rio had set forces in motion which ultimately transformed
Brazil. Free ports were open doors for ideas
and education as well as merchandise. Free manufacturing
and immigration diversified industry and
spread energetic habits. The influx of so many
educated Portuguese and the introduction of the
printing-press stimulated a desire for instruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
among the Brazilians. Ambition for employment
in the public service, the road to which, under the
Portuguese system, has always lain through the gates
of a university, co-operated. A considerable educated
class began to be formed, though the intellectual
movement never extended into the body of
the people. Through the former class the nation
found a means of expression. A spirit of inquiry
and unrest was roused, but the movement was intellectual
rather than instinctive; theoretical rather
than practical; from the top down, and directed
more toward revolutionising the central government
than developing local administration.</p>

<p>The first outbreak on Brazilian soil against absolutism
was the Pernambuco revolution of 1817.
Five lodges of Free Masons existed in the city;
the priests themselves were most earnest preachers
of political freedom; merchants and sugar-planters
wanted lower taxes; the prosperity of the sugar
trade had made the people self-confident. A conspiracy
was formed which had the sympathy of
many of the clergy and influential citizens. An attempt
to arrest the principal agitators resulted in a
riot; the troops were mostly Brazilian, and rose in
favour of their compatriots, and the populace joined
them. The governor fled, leaving the public departments,
and the treasury containing a million dollars
in the hands of the revolutionists. The movement
became at once frankly separatist and republican.
A Committee of Public Safety was named; the
Portuguese flags were torn down; a temporary
constitution proclaimed; a printing-press set up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
to publish a liberal newspaper. Messengers were
despatched to the interior and to the neighbouring
provinces to announce the overthrow of despotism
and to invite co-operation, but they met with no enthusiastic
reception. Fear of the aggressive Jacobinism
of the city of Pernambuco cooled the slave-owners
and conservatives, and the dignitaries on the
revolutionary committee were shocked by the impetuosity
of their radical colleagues. The insurgents
had not had time to provide themselves with arms,
and a Portuguese fleet from Bahia quickly blockaded
the port. When the royal troops came up they
found the interior of the province in civil war, and
the radicals were soon backed into the city, where a
short siege compelled them to capitulate. The more
aggressive leaders were shot by court-martial and a
military government was set up. Hundreds of prisoners
were carried off to Bahia, where they remained
until the great reaction of 1821.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE</h3>


<p>In 1820 the standard of revolt was raised in Cadiz
against the Spanish Bourbons, who, with the aid
of the Holy Alliance, had re-established absolutism
after the fall of Napoleon. The feeble Ferdinand
was compelled to accept a liberal constitution.
When the news reached Lisbon the Regency, acting
there for King John, was panic-stricken. Communication
with Spain was forbidden and word sent off
post-haste to John to urge his immediate return to
Portugal, or at least the sending of his eldest son, as
the only means of pacifying the deep dissatisfaction
felt because of the absence of the Court and government.
In Porto&mdash;always the centre of liberal movements&mdash;a
formidable conspiracy was formed which
included the leading citizens and the officers of the
garrison, and in August, 1820, the royal authority
was overthrown after scarcely a show of resistance,
and a provisional junta installed. The movement
spread over the northern provinces and thence to
Lisbon, where a junta assumed power in December.
After some confusion it was agreed temporarily to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
adopt the Spanish Constitution, to summon the
Cortes, and to retain the Braganza dynasty as constitutional
monarchs.</p>

<p>The news of the rising in Porto spread like wildfire
through the Portuguese possessions beyond sea.
Madeira and the Azores immediately installed revolutionary
juntas, and some of the Brazilian provinces
could not wait until the assembling of the
Cortes before establishing free governments. Among
native Brazilians and immigrated Portuguese, among
soldiers and citizens alike, the enthusiasm for a constitution
was well-nigh universal. In Par&aacute;, Pernambuco,
and Rio Grande do Sul, the royal governors
were dispossessed by the united soldiers and people,
and the Spanish Constitution proclaimed as the law
of the land. Rio, however, lay quiet, and it was
not until February, 1821, that the Bahia garrison
deposed the governor, and installed a provisional
junta, which, protesting allegiance to the House of
Braganza, proclaimed the Spanish Constitution,
nominated deputies to the Cortes, and promised to
adopt whatever definite constitution might be framed
by that body.</p>

<p>The action of Bahia was decisive. Throughout
the interior it met with approval. That John could
hope for no support from Brazil in case he decided
to make a struggle against the Portuguese revolutionists,
was evident. Reluctantly he issued a proclamation
announcing his intention to send Dom
Pedro, his eldest son, to treat with the Cortes, and
he promised to adopt such parts of the new constitution
as might be found expedient for Brazil. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
such delay native Brazilians and the Portuguese-born
were alike opposed. In Rio the troops and
people arose, demanding an unconditional promise
to ratify any constitution the Cortes might adopt.
On the 26th of February a great crowd assembled
in the streets, and while the cowardly King skulked
in his suburban palace, the Prince Pedro addressed
the people, swearing in his father's name and his
own to accept unreservedly the expected constitution.
The multitude insisted on marching out to the
King's palace to show their enthusiastic gratitude.
Trembling with fear John was forced to get into his
carriage, and the miserable man was frightened out
of his wits when the crowd took the horses out to
drag him with their own hands. He fainted away
and, when he recovered his senses, sat snivelling,
protesting between his sobs his willingness to agree
to anything, and sure that he was going to suffer the
fate of Louis XVI.</p>

<span class="caption">DOM PEDRO I.<br />
[From an old woodcut.]</span>
</div>

<p>Thereafter Dom Pedro, though only twenty-two
years old, was the principal figure in Brazil. He
resembled his passionate, unrestrained, and unscrupulous
mother rather than his vacillating, pusillanimous
father. He had grown up neglected and
uncontrolled in the midst of his parents' quarrelling
and the confusion of the removal to Brazil, receiving
no education except that of a soldier, and hardly
able to write his native tongue correctly. He was
handsome, brave, wilful, arrogant, loved riding and
driving, was eager and shameless in the pursuit of
pleasure. His manners were frank and attractive
and he was active-minded, quick to absorb new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>impressions, enterprising, strong-willed, loved popularity,
and intensely enjoyed being the principal dramatic
figure in any crisis. His personal courage was
unquestionable, and he was prompt of decision in
the face of dangers and difficulties. While capable
of warm friendships and with strong impulses of devotion
and gratitude, he lacked real faithfulness.
Between him and his father little love and no sympathy
existed. Prior to the events of 1821 he had not
been admitted to the councils in state affairs, and
his closest friends were among the young Portuguese
officers, who, like most of their class, sympathised
with the constitutional movement. Pedro was a
Free Mason, and the Liberal opinions advocated in
the lodges greatly influenced him. To Pedro, therefore,&mdash;young,
ardent, popular, holding progressive
notions,&mdash;both Brazilian and Portuguese Liberals
naturally turned.</p>

<p>Seeing the r&ocirc;le of leader and ruler of Brazil ready
to his hand, Pedro favoured the departure of his
father for Portugal. A meeting of the Rio electors,
held on the 21st of April, to elect members to the
Cortes suddenly changed into a tumult, and demanded
that the King assent to the Spanish Constitution
before his departure. He had no choice but
to yield, though probably neither he nor the popular
leaders had ever read the document. The demonstrations
continuing, Pedro became uneasy lest his
father's journey should be delayed, and marched his
troops into the square and cleared the people out
at the point of the bayonet. This audacious move
was followed by general stupefaction, and the King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
quietly escaped, leaving Pedro as regent. As his
vessel weighed anchor he said to his son: "I fear
Brazil before long will separate herself from Portugal;
if so, rather than allow the crown to fall to some
adventurer, place it on thy own head."</p>

<p>The grasping policy of the Portuguese members
of the Cortes furnished the impulse that drove the
Brazilians into union and independence. The Cortes
met in Lisbon, and, although most of the Brazilian
delegates had not arrived, immediately undertook
to pass measures touching the most important interests
of the younger kingdom. In December, 1821,
news reached Brazil that decrees had been enacted
requiring the prince to leave Brazil, abolishing the
appeal courts at Rio, creating governors who were
to supersede the juntas and be independent of
local control, and sending garrisons to the principal
cities. Tremendous popular excitement followed.
The coupling of the order for Pedro's retirement
with the provisions for the enslavement and disintegration
of Brazil, made the provinces realise that
he was the only centre around which they could
rally for effective resistance. A cry rose up from
the whole country, praying Pedro not to abandon
them. The address sent by the provincial junta of
S&atilde;o Paulo was penned by the hand of Jos&eacute; Bonifacio
de Andrada, and may well be called the Brazilian
declaration of independence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How dare these Portuguese deputies, without waiting
for the Brazilian members, promulgate laws which
affect the dearest interests of this realm? How dare
they dismember Brazil into isolated parts possessing no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
common centre of strength and union? How dare they
deprive your Royal Highness of the Regency with which
your august father, our Monarch, had invested you?
How dare they deprive Brazil of the tribunals instituted
for the interpretation and modification of laws; for the
general administration of ecclesiastical affairs, of finance,
commerce, and so many institutions of public utility?
To whom are the unhappy people hereafter to address
themselves for redress touching their business and
judicial interests?"</p></div>

<p>Jos&eacute; Bonifacio, whose voice and example, more
than any other man's, gave expression and direction
to the aspiration for independence, belonged to the
English parliamentary school which was dominant
then in liberal thought. The elevation of the young
and progressive prince to an independent throne
seemed an easy method of establishing constitutional
government, as well as of securing Brazil's autonomy.
Pedro did not hesitate long in acceding to the wish
of the Brazilians. On January 9, 1822, he formally
announced that he would remain in Brazil&mdash;thus defying
the Portuguese Cortes. The word "independence"
had not yet been employed, and there was a
very general hope that the Portuguese would listen
to reason when the Brazilian deputies arrived in Lisbon.
The only active resistance to Pedro in Brazil
came from the Portuguese soldiers, some of whom
revolted and went so far as to march under arms
to a point commanding the city of Rio, but their
nerve failed them in face of the immense concourse
of citizens who were preparing to fight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">DOM JOS&Eacute; BONIFACIO DE ANDRADA.<br />
[From a steel print.]</span>
</div>

<p>Pedro threw himself unreservedly into the hands
of the patriots. Jos&eacute; Bonifacio was made Prime
Minister, and measures taken to re-establish the
control of the central over the provincial governments.
But the ruling groups in the various capitals
were not very ready to surrender their authority.
Pedro called a council, but representatives from only
four provinces responded. Bahia and Pernambuco
were held in check by Portuguese garrisons, and
other provinces hesitated before committing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>selves.
Meanwhile the Portuguese majority in the
Cortes paid no attention to the warnings of the
Brazilian members, but ruthlessly pushed forward
the measures for the commercial and political subjection
of Brazil. Most of the Brazilian members
withdrew, while a squadron was sent to Rio to
escort the prince back to Portugal. On May 13
1822, he assumed the title of "Perpetual Defender
and Protector of Brazil," and from this to a formal
declaration of independence was only a step. In
June he notified the Cortes that Brazil must have
her own legislative body, and, on his own responsibility,
issued writs for a constituent assembly.
The Cortes responded by re-enforcing the Bahia garrison,
and the Bahianos retaliated by attacking the
Portuguese troops. The Pernambucanos expelled
their garrison and sent promises of adhesion to the
prince. On the 7th of September Pedro was in S&atilde;o
Paulo, and there received despatches telling of still
more violent measures taken by the Cortes, accompanied
by letters from Jos&eacute; Bonifacio urging that
the opportunity they had so often planned for together
had at last arrived. Pedro reflected but a
moment, and then, dramatically drawing his sword,
cried, "Independence or Death!" Everything had
been carefully timed, and his entrance into Rio a
few days later, wearing a cockade with the new device,
was greeted with enthusiasm. On the 12th of
October he was solemnly crowned "Constitutional
Emperor of Brazil," announcing that he would accept
the constitution to be drawn up by the approaching
constituent assembly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>Prompt and efficient measures for the expulsion
of the Portuguese garrisons from Bahia, Maranh&atilde;o,
Par&aacute;, and Montevideo were taken. The militia came
forward enthusiastically; the regular forces were
rapidly increased; Lord Cochrane, the celebrated
free-lance English admiral, was placed in command
of a fair-sized fleet which sailed at once for Bahia,
and, defeating the ships which remained faithful to
the Portuguese cause, established a blockade that
soon enabled the land forces besieging the city to
reduce the place. At Maranh&atilde;o Cochrane's success
was still easier; Par&aacute; also fell without resistance at
the summons of one of his captains; and the news
of these successes was followed by that of the surrender
of the garrison at Montevideo. Within less
than a year from the declaration of independence
not a hostile Portuguese soldier remained on Brazilian
soil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>REIGN OF PEDRO I.</h3>


<p>Independence was the result of a plan carefully
arranged by Jos&eacute; Bonifacio and his Brazilian
associates. Pedro had declared himself emperor
in an access of dramatic enthusiasm. He wanted
the glory of founding a great empire and he loved
to think of his name as that of the first legitimate
monarch who was really self-abnegating enough
to establish constitutional government of his own
free will. The r&ocirc;le of a Washington, with the
added glory of unselfishly resigning absolute power,
appealed to his boyish vanity. But the cold fit
came on when he undertook to perform his promises.
His loud protestations of constitutionalism
turned out to be mere windy mouthings. Though
his reign largely assisted in maintaining Brazil's territorial
unity, it cut off the promise of local self-government
and helped bring on twenty years of
bloody revolts. He was not exactly a hypocrite;
he loved to hear sonorous periods about liberty rolling
out of his mouth, but he had no idea of what
they really meant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>Jos&eacute; Bonifacio and his brothers remained at the
head of affairs when independence was declared, but,
ardent and successful as the older Andrada had been
in that movement, he proved no statesman, and had
not the strength to oppose his wilful young master.
Almost immediately the Andradas engaged in bitter
quarrels with the other leaders of the independence
party, and summarily banished the five ablest advocates
of a liberal constitution. They used their
power to revenge themselves on their personal enemies,
their secret police was worse than anything
John had maintained, and they forcibly suppressed
the newspapers which dared criticise their acts.
Pedro's authority was accepted slowly outside of
Rio. The ties binding the northern provinces to
him were especially feeble. A constituent assembly
had been summoned, but great difficulty was
experienced in securing a full representation. Pernambuco
and the neighbouring provinces hesitated
long before consenting to have anything to do with
it, and Par&aacute;, Maranh&atilde;o, and Piauhy were never represented.
It finally met in May, 1823, with only
fifty out of the one hundred members in their seats.
The Emperor opened the session with an arrogant
and dictatorial speech. "I promise to adopt and
defend the constitution which you may frame if it
should be worthy of Brazil and myself. We need a
constitution that will be an insurmountable barrier
against any invasion of the imperial prerogatives."
Such language excited an unexpected protest even
among the members of this humble and inexperienced
assembly.  Though a majority were magis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>trates,
they were not without a sense of the dignity
of their functions as legislators, and were eager for
liberty&mdash;a liberty interpreted according to their own
undigested theories.</p>

<p>The Andradas bitterly attacked those who dared
protest against the Emperor's language, and a majority
was only obtained for the government programme
by the lavish distribution of decorations. Pedro soon
tired of the Andradas and their fiercely anti-Portuguese
policy, and summarily dismissed them. The
disgraced ministers passed at once into the most
virulent opposition, and they inflamed popular prejudice
against the resident Portuguese and aroused
fears that the Emperor was plotting a reunion of
Brazil with Portugal. As the session went on, the
assembly showed a more independent spirit, and
Pedro became more and more irritated. The Brazilian
newspapers insulted his Portuguese officers and
the assembly took the part of the former. In November
matters reached a crisis. Pedro drew up his
troops in front of the assembly's meeting-house and
demanded immediate satisfaction to the insulted
officers and the expulsion of the Andradas. The
answer was a brave refusal, but against his cannon
nothing availed. He sent up an order for an instant
and unconditional dissolution, and, arresting
the Andradas and other Liberals as they came out
of the building, deported them on board ship without
the formality of charge or trial.</p>

<p>Pedro ordered a paper constitution to be drawn
up by his ministers. In form it was liberal, but he
had no serious intention of putting it in force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in Rio, the people ignored the invitation to
give their formal adhesion to this delusive document.
A show of acceptance was sought to be obtained
from the provinces by going through the form of
submitting it to the municipal councils. These
councils were then close corporations, largely self-elective,
and dominated by the bureaucratic caste,
but even so, north of Bahia they paid no attention
to the Emperor's communication, and in the South
some members had to be imprisoned before their
consent could be extorted. The Emperor swore to
the constitution, and it was gravely promulgated as
the nation's fundamental law, but no congress was
summoned, as a matter of fact the government
continued a pure despotism wherever the Emperor's
power extended. The press, which had sprung into
existence during the agitation for independence, and
which, after having been throttled by the Andradas,
had partly revived during the session of the constituent
assembly was now definitely suppressed.
Taxes were levied on the sole authority of the
monarch; laws were put into force without other
sanction than his will; citizens were arbitrarily banished,
and military tribunals condemned civilians to
death in time of peace.</p>

<p>We can never know the extent of the shock felt
by the Liberals on hearing of the forcible dissolution
of the constituent assembly. In Pernambuco it was
one of the stimulating causes of a rebellion. In that
city the press had not been suppressed and the spirit
of 1817 was still alive. A strong separatist feeling
existed, and when the junta resigned, the popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
choice made Carvalho Paes, who had been engaged
in the former rebellion, governor. The Emperor
sent up his own man, but authorities and people refused
to recognise him. An open breach followed,
and Pedro, with his usual vigour, undertook to
establish his dominion over the hitherto aloof North.</p>

<p>In July, 1824, the Pernambucanos threw down
the gauntlet by proclaiming the "Confederation of
the Equator." This was intended to be a federal
republic after the model of the union between the
provinces of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.
The adhesion of Pernambuco, Parahyba, Rio Grande
do Norte, and Cear&aacute; could be counted upon, and
that of Maranh&atilde;o, Par&aacute;, and Bahia was hoped for.
Bahia, however, remained apathetic, and that city
furnished Pedro a convenient base for his operations.
He sent Admiral Cochrane to blockade and bombard
Pernambuco, while an army marched up the coast.
Factional civil war had broken out in the interior of
the revolted provinces, and the imperial forces were
joined by Carvalho's local enemies. The patriots
fought desperately, but were overwhelmed before
they could provide themselves with arms or organise
their resistance. The city had to surrender on the
17th of September, though fighting was kept up for
a long time in the interior. Cochrane sailed north,
reducing the ports one by one, and by the end of
the year the serious resistance was at an end.</p>

<p>The victorious Emperor punished the patriots
with ruthless severity, sending many of the leaders
to the scaffold, and establishing military tribunals
which inaugurated a reign of terror. An Englishman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
named Ratcliff was brought to Rio and hanged, not
so much for his part in the insurrection as because
he had once offended Pedro's mother in Portugal.
"She offered a reward for his head," said the Emperor
as he signed the death-warrant, "but now she
shall have it for nothing." In the spring of 1825 it
seemed as if Pedro was certain to establish himself
at the head of a military despotism extending from
the Amazon to the Plate. Before the Pernambuco
insurrection his revenue and recruits had been drawn
solely from Rio and the adjacent provinces. Now
his fleet and disciplined army, recruited by impressment
and concentrated under his eye, enabled him
to get revenue from all the ports and to hold the provinces
in check. His sea-power and his possession
of the purse-strings gave him a tremendous advantage.
He imported Germans, Swiss, and Irish with
a view to forming a corps of janizaries. All Brazil
seemed submissive, and the enthusiasm which had
flamed out among the Brazilians in 1821 and 1822
had died down, leaving as its only permanent effect
a strong sentiment against reunion with Portugal.</p>

<p>Externally his position seemed secure. He was
assured of Canning's active support in securing
formal recognition as an independent monarch;
Portugal was helpless; though his application for
a defensive and offensive alliance had been refused
by Henry Clay, the United States was the first to
recognise Brazil's independence; even the Holy
Alliance had little objection to an independent
American state ruled by a legitimate monarch. In
the summer of 1825 a treaty of peace was framed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
between Portugal and Brazil through the intermediation
of England. Independence was formally recognised,
but Pedro made the error of consenting that
his father should take the honorary title of Emperor
of Brazil, and by a secret article he pledged Brazil
to assume ten millions of the Portuguese debt,
though it had been incurred in war against herself.</p>

<p>In March, 1825, a rebellion against Pedro broke
out in Uruguay, and the Argentine gauchos swarmed
over the border. The Brazilians easily held the
fortified city of Montevideo, but the Spanish-Americans
were successful in the open field, and after six
months of harassing fighting caught the imperial
army in a disadvantageous position and cut it to
pieces in the decisive battle of Sarandy. The Buenos
Aires government at once gave notice that it
must recognise that Uruguay had reunited itself
to the Argentine, and Pedro responded with a
declaration of war and a blockade.</p>

<p>The preparations for war involved him in unprecedented
expenditures, which piled up the debt already
accumulated in his father's time and added
to by the war of independence and the suppression
of the "Confederation of the Equator." He decided
to call together the representatives of the
people and insist that they bear a share of the responsibility.
So little interest was taken that it
was hard to hold the elections, and the members
had to be urged to present themselves. On the
3rd of May, 1826, the first Brazilian Congress met.
Intended as a mere instrument to furnish supplies
for the war, and meeting with the fear of the fate of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
the constituent assembly before its eyes, it hesitatingly
began the work of parliamentary government.
Except for the revolution of 1889, the sessions have
never since been interrupted.</p>

<p>A week before the assembling of Congress the
news reached Brazil that King John was dead. Pedro
was the eldest son, but his brother Miguel was
a candidate for the vacant throne. Pedro had to
make an immediate choice between the two crowns.
He decided to keep that of Brazil and to transfer
that of Portugal to his daughter, Maria Gloria, then
a child seven years old. He tried to head off Miguel
by making the latter regent and promising that
Maria should marry him as soon as she was old
enough, while he tied his brother's hands by promulgating
a constitution for Portugal. The scheme
failed to preserve the peace, and the Portuguese
absolutists, supporting Miguel, and the constitutionalists,
Maria Gloria, almost immediately became
involved in a civil war. During the latter part of
Pedro's reign he was continually preoccupied with
Portuguese affairs and trying to promote his daughter's
fortunes in Europe.</p>

<p>The war on the Plate turned out difficult and disastrous.
Notwithstanding that great land forces
were sent, no progress was made toward reducing
Uruguay to obedience, and the overwhelming naval
force blockading Buenos Aires was harassed by a
small fleet improvised by an able Irishman&mdash;Admiral
Brown&mdash;in the Argentine service. Fast-sailing
Baltimore clippers fitted out as privateers infested
the whole Brazilian coast, often venturing in sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
of Rio and soon sweeping the coasting trade out of
existence. Fruitless attempts to enforce the blockade
involved Pedro in difficulties with neutral powers;
Brazilian merchants were disgusted with the
war, and communication between the provinces
became nearly impossible.</p>

<p>The Brazilian land forces in Uruguay were increased
to twenty thousand, but the Argentines under
General Carlos Alvear audaciously averted the
danger of an invasion of their territory by planning
and effecting an inroad into Rio Grande itself. The
Brazilian general allowed Alvear to slip between his
main body and Montevideo, and the latter penetrated
to the East, sacked the important town of
Bag&eacute;, and was off to the North with the whole
Brazilian army in hot pursuit. On the 20th of
February, 1827, the Argentines turned and attacked
the Brazilians at a disadvantage, defeating them
with great loss. In this battle of Ituzaingo sixteen
thousand men took part, and the armies were nearly
equal in numbers. The Brazilians escaped without
serious pursuit, while the Argentines retired at their
leisure, assured that no aggressive operations would
soon be undertaken against them. Pedro's hope of
dominance on the south shore of the Plate was
ended. Naval disasters suffered at the hands of the
indefatigable Brown made him still more anxious for
peace. Negotiations were begun with the Argentine
government which was only prevented by lack
of money and internal factional quarrels from undertaking
an aggressive war against Brazilian territory.
Operations were kept up languidly on both sides for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
a year, and finally Pedro in 1828 consented to a
preliminary treaty by which he relinquished his
sovereignty over Uruguay, obtaining in return Argentine
consent that it be erected into an independent
country.</p>

<p>The first session of the Brazilian Congress had
been very timid and voted as the Emperor desired.
The session of 1827 was not so respectful; the news
of Ituzaingo had made him seem less formidable.
For the first time the chamber became a forum for
the discussion of governmental theories, and the
voice of Vasconcellos, the great champion of parliamentary
government, was heard. In the fall of 1827
independent newspapers began to make their appearance
and Pedro dared not interfere with them.
The tone of most of them was exaggerated, but in
December the <i>Aurora Fluminense</i>, with Evaristo da
Veiga as editor, issued its first number. By universal
consent he is recognised as the most influential
journalist who ever wielded a pen in Brazil. His
profound and temperate discussions of public affairs
gave him an ascendency over opinion which can
hardly be understood in countries where party conventions
and set speeches give opportunities for
authoritatively outlining policies.</p>

</div>

<p>When Congress met in May, 1828, the Emperor
and his government had completely lost prestige.
The public's and Chamber's consciousness of their
rights and their power had made a distinct advance.
Vasconcellos infused into the debates an independent
and statesmanlike spirit not unworthy the great
popular assemblies of the most advanced countries.
The youth of this remarkable man had been passed
in pleasure-seeking, but his election to Congress
gave him an object in life commensurate with his
great abilities, and he applied himself with unquenchable
ardour to the study of political science.
Corrupt in morals, inordinate in ambition, his venality
notorious, his constitution ruined by disease, his
skin withered, his hair grey, and his appearance that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>of a man of sixty, though he was but thirty, the
spirit within rose superior to all physical and moral
defects. His r&ocirc;le was peculiarly that of champion
of the prerogatives of Congress. By his side was
Padre Feij&oacute;, afterwards regent&mdash;incorruptible in
morals and unyielding in will&mdash;the champion of
federation and democracy, and the earliest Brazilian
positivist.</p>

<p>This Chamber of 1828 made a real beginning
toward making ministries responsible to Congress,
and started legal and administrative reforms, but
the Emperor insisted that its sole attention be given
to increasing taxes. When the Chamber definitely
refused in 1829 he dissolved it in the hope that the
next might prove more tractable. This act destroyed
the last remnants of Pedro's popularity.
From that moment his abdication or expulsion was
inevitable. His friends tried to create a reaction
by organising societies in favour of absolutism, and
governors of retrograde principles were appointed,
but the popular irritation against him because he
was a Portuguese by birth and sympathy constantly
grew. Brazil divided into two parties&mdash;all the
Brazilians belonged to one and only the resident
Portuguese to the other. The new Chamber was
harder to manage than the old one. The Andradas
had returned from exile, and most of the new members
were bitterly prejudiced against Pedro. In the
midst of the discontent came the news of the July
revolution in Paris, giving the liberal propaganda a
tremendous impetus. The assassination of a newspaper
man named Badaro in November, 1830,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
aroused popular indignation to a fearful pitch.
Pedro made a last effort to regain his popularity by
making a journey through the province of Minas.
His cold reception convinced him that the disaffection
was not merely local, and he returned to Rio sick
at heart. In March, 1831, disturbances broke out in
the Rio streets between the radicals and the Portuguese.
Vasconcellos and Feij&oacute; were absent, but
Evaristo drew up a manifesto demanding immediate
reparation for the outrages committed by the rioting
Portuguese. The Emperor tried to still the rising
storm by dismissing his ministry, but the rioting
continued and he suddenly again changed front and
appointed a ministry of known reactionary principles.
The announcement was followed on the 7th
of April by the assembling of a mob, among whose
members were professional men, public employees,
and even soldiers and deputies. Pedro's proclamation
was torn from the messengers' hands and
trampled under foot beneath the windows of his
palace. The troops were all on the popular side.
A committee crowded its way into the Emperor's
presence, but he would yield nothing to compulsion,
saying with dignity: "I will do everything for the
people, but nothing by the people." The news of
the desertion of the very troops guarding his person
he received with equanimity, but the populace
showed equal stubbornness. Throughout the night
the crowd stuck to their posts, and about two o'clock
in the morning he suddenly drew up to a table and,
without consulting any one, wrote out an unconditional
abdication in favour of his infant son.  The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
ministers of France and Great Britain had remained
with him during this night of anxiety, and when
the morning came they were reluctant to accept his
abdication as final. All the foreign diplomats except
the representatives of the United States and
Colombia followed him on board the British warship,
where he took refuge. They wished to give
him their moral support in case a counter-revolution
were attempted.</p>

<p>The most potent cause for Pedro's loss of popularity
was that he was a Portuguese. He offended
the self-love of a jealous people in a hundred ways
by favouring his Portuguese friends. Almost as
fatal was his treatment of his blameless wife. One
mistress after another succeeded to his favours, and
he acknowledged and ennobled his illegitimate
children. Most of his concubines did not hold him
long, but the last, who was said to be of English
descent, acquired a complete ascendancy over him.
He publicly installed her as his mistress; created her
a marchioness; forced the Empress to accept her as
a lady-in-waiting and submit to ride in the same carriage
with her. The court attended in a body the
baptism of her child, and some of his love letters to
her are indescribable. They could have been written
only by a degenerate. In the fall of 1826 the
poor Empress was <i>enceinte</i> with her seventh child
in nine years, and while in this condition Pedro
brutally abused her. She never recovered and died
in the most fearful agony. Pedro was absent looking
after the war in the Plate, but the marchioness
had the heartless effrontery to demand admittance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
to the sick-room, and Pedro on his return dismissed
the ministers who had dared to approve the action
of the official who refused to let his mistress gloat
over the tortured deathbed of his wife.</p>

<p>Pedro was too boyish, talkative, and familiar to
maintain an ascendancy over such a people as the
Brazilians. At all hours of the day and night he
was to be seen driving furiously about the streets,
and he constantly showed himself in the theatres.
He liked to drill his troops himself, and frequently
beat the soldiers with his own imperial hand. Once
he nearly maimed himself striking at a stupid recruit
with his sword, and, missing the blow, catching
his own foot. On another occasion he almost killed
himself and two members of his family by overturning
his carriage. He was always ready to explain
to any mob at hand his reasons for his official policy,
and was too fond of excitement and applause to
refrain from making a speech whenever he had a
chance. The inmost emotions of his heart were too
cheaply exhibited on the Rio streets for the populace
to have much respect for them. He was a belated
knight-errant with a decided touch of the demagogue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE REGENCY</h3>


<p>After Pedro's expulsion the country was left
in a very insecure situation. In Rio the Portuguese
were as numerous as the native Brazilians.
A great part of the population was under
arms and radicalism and revolution were in the air;
but, for the moment, fear of the Portuguese and of
Pedro's restoration enabled cool-headed, conservative
leaders to maintain peace. The members of
Congress in the city selected a provisional regency.
The ministry, whose dismissal had been the occasion
of the outbreak against Pedro, returned to power
and, so far as Rio was concerned, government proceeded
without interruption. Within a few weeks
Congress met in regular session, and a permanent
regency was elected. Bahia had revolted and expelled
the pro-Portuguese military commander even
before Pedro's deposition by Rio. When the news
of the events of the 7th of April reached Pernambuco
and Par&aacute; the troops promptly renounced their
commanders.</p>

<p>In Congress grave differences of opinion appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
The Brazilian party quickly divided into two factions&mdash;the
conservatives, who were faithful to the dynasty
and wanted the fewest possible changes, and the
radicals. The former had stepped into control
ahead of the latter, but they had not the real force
of the country behind them. There was a growing
demand for a larger measure of self-government by
the provinces and for sweeping democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The regency had no real prestige, the military
soon became jealous and dissatisfied, and the party
in favour of the Emperor's restoration began to assume
a formidably menacing attitude. In July Rio
seemed on the point of plunging into a bloody
and desperate civil war. The Regency called upon
Padre Feij&oacute;, the great patriot priest and leader of
democratic opinion, and gave him absolute power as
minister of justice. His firm measures soon suppressed
the disorders in Rio, and the national guard
which he organised among the better classes of the
people held the revolting regiments in check. In
the provinces, however, the local authorities often
ignored the commands of the governors appointed
by the regency; ambitious local leaders plotted to
turn the situation to their personal advantage; and
the soldiers and disorderly elements were inflammable
material ready to their hands.</p>

<p>In nearly every province civil wars broke out.
The typical process was for a military officer, a
national-guard colonel, or any other person who
had acquired local prestige, to issue a pronunciamento
and announce the establishment of a liberal
government whose scope was only limited by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
imagination and knowledge of constitutional law
possessed by the writer of the pronunciamento. If
the municipal authorities resisted they were expelled,
and creatures of the head of the insurrection put in
their places. This overturning of legally existing
authority would usually be resented by some neighbouring
official or some rival of the petty dictator,
and a confused conflict would ensue in which the
rank and file of neither side would have a very clear
conception of what they were fighting about, although
the words of "liberty" and "local rights,"
"constitutionalism" and "union," were overworked
in speeches and proclamations. It is not worth while
to give the detailed story of these monotonous and
tedious uprisings, massacres, encounters, and usurpations,
though the operations often rose to the dignity
of campaigns and pitched battles. Hardly a province
escaped. In Pernambuco in 1831 the soldiery
sacked the city and the people avenged themselves
by killing three hundred and banishing the rest.
Next year another military revolt broke out in the
same city, which soon became an insurrection whose
nominal purpose was to restore the Emperor, and
which lasted four years. Two hundred persons
were killed in Par&aacute; in 1831 during a single night of
street fighting. A bitter little civil war in Maranh&atilde;o
lasted all through the winter of 1831-32, and was
only put down by a general sent from Rio. In
Cear&aacute; the partisans of the Emperor kept the province
in a state of anarchy for several months. In Minas
Geraes the friends of Pedro obtained possession of
the capital, and the patriots had to fight hard to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
the better of them. Though most of these insurrections
were suppressed by the people of the state
concerned, disrespect for the central government
was increasing, and a blind and jealous hatred of
the Portuguese and everything foreign grew continuously.</p>

<p>During the four stormy years which succeeded
Pedro's expulsion, Congress discussed violently the
terms of the constitutional revision which all saw
to be inevitable. Though the radical elements predominated,
the conservatives and the senate succeeded
in bringing about a compromise. A single
regent was substituted for the triple system; he
was to be elected by universal though indirect suffrage;
and, most important of all, each province
was given its own assembly with power to levy
taxes and conduct most of the affairs of local government.
The conservatives managed to preserve the
life senate and the nomination of the provincial
governors by the central government.</p>

<p>The party in favour of Pedro's restoration had
been gaining ground. The Andradas, always in the
most extreme opposition when out of power, went
over to it, and the conservatives were gravitating in
the same direction when Pedro's own death in 1834
put an end to the movement. He died at a happy
moment for his fame,&mdash;covered with the laurels he
had just won by driving out his usurping and absolutist
brother, Miguel, and by using that opportunity
to endow Portugal with a constitution. By
a curious irony of fate, this reckless soldier and
descendant of a hundred absolute kings was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
instrument through which constitutional government
was given to both branches of the Portuguese
race.</p>

<p>The statesman who had proved himself most nearly
master of the situation during these stormy
years was Padre Feij&oacute;. He represented the average
Brazilian&mdash;the disinterested and honest public.
He had energy and intrepidity; his eloquence was
peculiar and commanding; his advocacy of his beliefs
was uncompromising; he had been a leader in
sustaining liberal ideas; and he had proven his practical
courage and capacity in putting down the
counter-revolution in Rio. He naturally became a
candidate for sole regent after the passage of the
<i>Acto Addicional</i>, or amendment to the constitution.
It seemed appropriate that to him should be entrusted
the putting into force of the law which was
expected to change Brazil into a federation of democracies
united under a constitutional monarchy.
Elected after a close contest, he took office in the
latter part of 1835, sincerely anxious to rule well and
sustained by a popular love and confidence such as
few Brazilian statesmen have enjoyed. However,
from the beginning he was unable to count on the
support of a majority of the Chamber. He was not
the man to manage by adroit manipulation and skilful
distribution of patronage, but his own work and
that of Vasconcellos had borne fruit, and the popular
branch of the legislature had become the dominating
political force in the Brazilian system. The tide
was now setting toward conservatism; the heroic
impulses that had brought about the revolution of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
1831 had lost their force; the nation's temper was
cooled; the politicians had forgotten their fine
enthusiasm and were busily engaged in personal
intrigues.</p>

<p>Feij&oacute; inherited from the former regency the two
most formidable revolutions which so far had broken
out&mdash;that of Vinagre and Malcher in Par&aacute;, and
the great rebellion in Rio Grande do Sul. He was
hardly fitted to deal with such a complicated situation
as that of Brazil in 1836. He himself said: "I
am a man to break, never to bend." Though he
gave the officeholders of Brazil an object-lesson in
unblemished integrity, his actions were often harsh
and arbitrary. When on the floor of the Chamber
he had been the chief exponent of democracy, but
as chief executive he rode roughshod over his inferiors,
refused to be guided by others, even in
matters where no principle was involved, and proved
that he had the true Latin tendency to centralise
administration.</p>

<p>Vasconcellos soon outgeneralled Feij&oacute;. A dread
of innovation was spreading among the landholding
classes. The merchants and Portuguese of the cities
naturally gravitated away from the radical regent.
The opposition majority in the Chamber, compactly
organised by Vasconcellos's skilful management,
was encouraged, feeling that it was backed by the
mercantile and office-holding classes, and by the
persons of highest intelligence and best social position.
It clung together with a cohesion unusual in
South America, and was the foundation upon which
the historical parties were built whose names are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
constantly encountered in Brazilian political history
for the next fifty years.</p>

<p>For two years Feij&oacute; struggled against the adverse
conditions. For the Par&aacute; revolution he found a
clever and faithful general in Andrea, and managed
to keep him well supplied with money and
troops, so that a vigorous pursuit of the guerrilla
chiefs resulted in their capture and the pacification
of the province. But in Rio Grande the people
were too strong and too independent to be reduced
by troops sent from without, and Congress hampered
him by refusing votes of credit. The revolution
which had broken out there three months before he
assumed the regency had been occasioned by anti-Portuguese
feeling and the unpopularity of the governor.
The latter was obliged to flee from Porto
Alegre with hardly a semblance of resistance. At
first Feij&oacute; wisely limited his interference to the
nomination of a new governor. It was not safe to
irritate the half-feudal chiefs, backed by their bands
of gauchos trained in constant raids over the Uruguayan
border and who were too accustomed to seeing
revolutions on the Spanish side to hesitate much
about undertaking one on their own account. But
the new governor was ambitious and tried to take
advantage of the jealousies among the gaucho leaders
to make himself supreme. He got some of the
ablest of them on his side, but the others were
stimulated into more determined fighting. The
rebels kept the field in formidable numbers, and
among their able partisan chiefs was Giuseppe
Garibaldi, who here took part in his first war for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
freedom. At first evil fortune followed the patriots,
and they were badly defeated in the battle of Fanfa,
where their greatest leader, Bento Gon&ccedil;alves, was
captured and carried to Rio. His lieutenants rallied
again and declared Rio Grande an independent republic.</p>

<p>Feij&oacute; despatched a new governor, whose oppressive
measures soon brought about a wholesale desertion
by the Rio Grandenses, who had hitherto
supported the union side. By the middle of 1837
Rio Grande seemed hopelessly lost to Brazil, and
the government only held the coast towns.</p>

<p>His bad management of affairs in Rio Grande was
the immediate occasion of Feij&oacute;'s resignation (September,
1837). The victorious conservative majority
immediately stepped into power. Bernardo de Vasconcellos
reaped at length a personal reward for his
years of labour and intrigue, and became the ruling
force in the Chamber, and Prime Minister, though a
wealthy senator, Araujo Lima by name, had been
elected regent. But Vasconcellos was merely the
first among equals and held his power only so
long as he could command the support of the conservative
majority. A sort of oligarchy grew up
which directed the work of reaction without much
more regard for outside opinion than Pedro himself
had shown. However, Brazil had finally entered
upon a stage of government which in form was
parliamentary and in substance was partly so. It
was rather the parliamentarism of Walpole than of
Gladstone; the members owed their seats to the administration;
they were a sort of self-nominating and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
self-renewing body; and departmental and judicial
administration continued in much the same old way.</p>

<p>The great task before the conservative regency
was to undo most of the work which had been
wrought by the federalist and democratic movement
of the early 30's. The amendments to the constitution,
known as the <i>Acto Addicional</i>, had apparently
established the autonomy of the provinces
in their local affairs. If these amendments had
been put into effect, Brazil would have become a
federated state like Switzerland or the United
States. The conservatives were alarmed at the
length to which the provincial assemblies were already
going in managing their own affairs, and succeeded
in turning the country back on the road
toward centralisation and unification. A law was
passed which interpreted the <i>Acto Addicional</i> so as
nearly to destroy provincial autonomy. The provincial
assemblies were forbidden to interfere with
the magistracy; their resolutions could be vetoed
by the governors or the national Congress; their
power of controlling the administration of justice was
taken away. They became little more than advisory
bodies completely under the dominance of governors
appointed from Rio, and who rarely were citizens of
the states they ruled. At first there was little opposition,
and the regency easily suppressed a separatist
movement in Bahia which proposed to establish a
republic until the boy emperor should come of age.</p>

<span class="caption">DONNA JANUARIA.<br />
[From a steel engraving.]</span>
</div>

<p>The reorganised regency was, however, weak.
The attitude of the nation was merely tolerant and
expectant.  The war in Rio Grande, continued and
the attacks of the Liberals in the Chamber increased
in force and effectiveness. Ministers began to change
and shift; the conviction grew that the conservative
oligarchy would not long rule the country. Liberals
and conservatives alike inclined to the idea that the
best thing was to return to a ruler selected from the
legitimate royal family.  According to the constitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>tion
the boy emperor would not become of age until
he reached eighteen, in 1843. If the constitution
were strictly followed the country would have to be
governed for years by a hybrid executive&mdash;a regent
who was neither a ruler by popular choice nor yet
a monarch by blood and succession. Many advocated
declaring the Emperor's eldest sister, Januaria,
regent, though the young lady protested tearfully
against being turned into such a thing as she
imagined a regent to be. More insisted that the
Emperor, in spite of his tender years, immediately
assume the functions of supreme ruler.</p>

<p>The politicians in opposition, with the two surviving
Andradas at their head, took advantage of this
feeling. Bills were introduced in Congress authorising
the Emperor to take the reins at once. The
regent's ministers did not dare directly oppose these
measures; they only tried to compromise as long
as possible. But difficulties and dissatisfaction increased;
a formidable revolution broke out in Maranh&atilde;o;
the Rio Grandenses invaded Santa Catharina.
It was evident that the regency could not continue
to hold the clashing provinces together. While the
intellectual conviction had never been stronger that
union between the provinces was an advantage, circumstances
were increasing dissatisfaction and insubordination
in every part of the empire.</p>

<p>The contest in Congress over the Emperor's majority
assumed an acute phase as soon as the session
of 1840 began. The ministry in desperation sought
to prevent immediate action by calling Vasconcellos
back to power and proroguing the session. The announcement
of this step was followed by an outburst
that left no recourse but a submission of the matter
in dispute to the boy emperor himself. The opposition
deputies went out in a body to see him, and
begged him to consent to assume his imperial functions
at once. Though entirely unauthorised by the
constitution, no one made serious objection to such
a revolutionary way of proceeding. The young
Pedro accepted with dignity and confidence; the
city and country went wild with delight, and on the
23rd of July, 1840, Congress assembled in a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
extraordinary constituent assembly and without a
dissenting voice proclaimed him of age.</p>

<p>Although the ten years of the regency were the
stormiest in Brazilian history, they were in many
respects the most fruitful. The nation was serving
an apprenticeship in governing itself; its public men
were being trained; the value of self-restraint and of
peace were being learned. The freedom of the press
and of parliament was definitely established. The
production of literature began; professional schools
were put on a footing not unworthy of any civilised
country; learned societies were organised; the study
of the resources of the country was continued; social
intercourse developed; communication between the
provinces increased; the study of foreign languages
became general among the polite classes.</p>

<p>Industrially, too, the period was one of germination
of those seeds from which subsequently grew
the prosperity of the country. Though foreign
commerce increased little during the civil wars, the
cultivation of coffee assumed large proportions,
and while sugar and cotton, food crops and tobacco,
suffered much from foreign competition and civil
disturbances, nevertheless they held up pretty well.
The confusion of the times and the weakness of the
central government prevented any great improvement
in the public finances, but neither taxes nor
debt were piled up as they had been under Pedro I.
Though the efficiency and honesty of the administration
left much to be desired, the small resources of
which the central government disposed brought about
an era of comparative economy in the departments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>PEDRO II.</h3>


<p>The so-called Liberals went into power on the
declaration of the Emperor's majority, and
proved to be more tyrannical and centralising than
the Conservatives whom they had replaced. Provincial
governors were dismissed wholesale solely for
factional advantage. The Chamber of Deputies was
dissolved and a new one elected in the fall of 1840,
and in the choice of deputies the Andradas interfered,
securing an overwhelming Liberal majority.</p>

<p>In reality, however, the Andradas had not won
the confidence of the ruling <i>coteries</i>, nor of the boy
emperor. When they quarrelled with Aureliano,
one of their colleagues, the matter was submitted to
Pedro, who was then only fifteen and a half years
old. His decision was against the Andradas. They
resigned, and from that moment until his mental
powers began to fail Pedro II. was the supreme
authority in the State. He governed parliamentarily
as far as he deemed it possible, left most matters to
his Cabinets, kept out of view, and was careful to
ascertain public opinion.  None the less he was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
final arbiter in matters of the first importance. In
the politics of the next fifty years he was incomparably
the most potent Brazilian.</p>

<p>Happily for his country he resembled his mother
rather than his father. Studious and laborious,
books were his great occupation. He was an indefatigable
and omnivorous reader, and, though especially
fond of history and sociology, few subjects
and few literatures escaped him. No fact ever failed
to interest him, but his mind was too discursive and
his studies too widespread and too superficial to give
him a store of sound and well-digested knowledge.
Morally he was a complete contrast to his dissipated
father. He was a monarch of the conscientious nineteenth-century
type. He as a little boy had been
obedient to the priests and ladies to whom his rearing
had been entrusted, but they retained no great
influence over him. Though thoroughly respectful
toward religion he was not especially devout, and
his political ideas were gathered rather from his own
reading than from direct teaching. As a father and
husband he was good and kind, and conscientiously
devoted all his energies to the performance of his
duties, public and private. His first act on assuming
power was to forbid the people of his household
to ask any favours of him in regard to public
affairs.</p>

<p>His manners were democratic. Though tall and
handsome he cared little for his personal appearance;
his clothing was ill-fitting and ill cared for; he drove
about in rickety old carriages with absurd-looking
horses; he kept no Court properly so called; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
would gobble through his state dinners in a hurry to
get back to his books; he would call Cabinet meetings
at inconvenient hours of the night if an idea
struck him. Though his subjects loved and trusted
him, the general tendency was rather to laugh at his
peculiarities. It could hardly be said that people
personally stood much in awe of him. At the same
time, when action was to be taken in a crisis, he
could be as arbitrary as any czar. He took no pride
in imposing his will over that of others, and his
manners and methods were always mild and gentle.
Some believe that he deliberately assumed careless,
democratic ways, thinking them best adapted to
maintaining himself in power, and it is certain that
he showed little anxiety about his position and
seemed to value it slightly. Intellectually restless
though he was, his judgment was sound enough to
enable him soon to foresee that the inevitable tendency
was toward a republic, and in the latter part
of his life he often said that he was the best republican
in the empire, and that his main function was to
prepare the way for it. At bottom he was not a
man of strong passions or intense will, but was rather
a mild-mannered and philosophic opportunist whose
greatest merit was that he loved peace, and whose
greatest achievement was that Brazil remained internally
quiet during his long reign.</p>

<p>With the fall of the Andradas the Conservative
party returned to power, and a reactionary parliamentary
government, with the Emperor as a sort
of regulating and controlling <i>deus ex machina</i>, was
definitely installed. Great things were hoped for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
from the new r&eacute;gime, and loyalty to the young Emperor
was enthusiastic, sincere, and universal. However,
the internal disturbances were too serious to
be calmed in a day. The revolution in Maranh&atilde;o,
which had been bequeathed by the Regency, was
formidable. In pacifying it a general named Luiz
Lima e Silva first came to the front, and was named
Baron of Caxias for his services. This officer was
less than forty years of age, and came of a family
of soldiers, one of whom had been the military
member of the first Regency. He had served in all
the wars and most of the insurrections since 1822,
and had always shown solid though not especially
brilliant qualities. He was a good manager of men,
and a steady, pertinacious, and shrewd negotiator.
His detractors accuse him of unscrupulous bribery,
and it is certain that he was extraordinarily successful
in sowing discord among his opponents. He obeyed
the orders of his superiors and was faithful to the
Emperor. Probably the limitations of his character
were as important as his affirmative abilities in
enabling him to grow into the great military consolidator
of the distracted empire. His work in the
first years of the forties was hardly inferior in importance
to that of the Emperor himself.</p>

</div>

<p>The return to power of the Conservatives in 1841
caused great dissatisfaction among the displaced
Liberals and the advocates of provincial autonomy.
The Conservatives seemed to have captured the
young emperor, and the Liberals began to insist on
the application to Brazil of the English maxim,
"The king reigns but does not govern."  In 1842 a
revolution broke out in Sorocaba, the home of
Padre Feij&oacute;, in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo. The trouble
was aggravated by the harsh measures taken by the
Conservative governor to suppress it, and soon spread
to various points in the province and thence to Minas
Geraes. The revolutionists announced that their
objects were to free the Emperor from the coercion
of the Conservative oligarchy; to maintain the autonomy
of the provinces; and to preserve the constitution,
whose guarantees were being rendered
nugatory. Fighting only lasted two months, but
there were fifteen important fights in Minas and five
in S&atilde;o Paulo. The government forces under Caxias
were completely victorious, and in the final and decisive
battle of Santa Luzia he overwhelmed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
dispersed three thousand men and captured all the
principal leaders. The Emperor and Caxias adopted
a magnanimous and conciliatory policy toward the
defeated rebels, though the Conservative ministers
persisted in advocating harsh measures.</p>

<p>Only Rio Grande do Sul remained under arms,
and even there the rebels were not averse to accepting
the Emperor's authority. As soon as Caxias had
finished the pacification of Minas, he was ordered
south. The campaign began by his winning two
important victories, and he followed them up by
promises of amnesty which detached some of the
most formidable rebel chiefs. Finally, in the spring
of 1845, Rio Grande returned to the Brazilian union
on the concession of a full and complete amnesty.
That province has ever since enjoyed a larger measure
of autonomy than any other part of Brazil.</p>

<p>By the beginning of 1844 the disintegrating effects
of a long continuance in power showed itself among
the Conservatives. The Cabinet came to an issue
with the Emperor over a question of an appointment,
and he called the Liberals to power. The
new government was ready to carry out the Emperor's
policy of full and free amnesty and pacification
by concession. With the collapse of the
revolution in Rio Grande the central government
seemed at length to have passed all danger. The
demands for a juster interpretation of the <i>Acto
Addicional</i> and for a larger measure of autonomy
to the provinces and municipalities died out altogether,
or took a peaceful form. The Liberals in
power turned out to be as conservative as the Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>servatives
themselves, and the work of consolidation
and centralisation proceeded uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>The Liberal ministry, was, however, in a false
situation. The very name they bore was an implied
promise to effect reforms. Their majority soon split
up into warring factions. Congress spent the session
of 1848 in quarrelsome debates; the fall of
Louis Philippe had diffused a spirit of revolution in
the air; the municipal elections were accompanied by
riots, and the ministry itself deliberately encouraged
a renewal of the anti-Portuguese agitation. The
Emperor thought himself obliged to intervene, and
appointed a Conservative Cabinet. In Pernambuco
the new Conservative governor displaced the Liberal
officials who had been holding office for the last
three years. The latter were anti-Rio and anti-Portuguese,
and they and their partisans started
an insurrection known as that of the <i>praieiros</i>. It
quickly assumed a formidable character and as many
as two thousand revolutionists took part in a single
battle, but after three months of fighting they were
completely defeated. Little difficulty was experienced
in restoring public order. The movement
had been rather a partisan uprising than a general
popular revolution.</p>

<p>This was the last attempt for more than forty
years to establish a federal system. The necessities
of the stormy period from 1827 to 1848 had led, step
by step, to a form of government which was centralised
and yet not absolute. The imperial system had
been the result of a natural growth. When the
fabric reached stability the professional ruling classes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
feared to disturb it, and the people were too inert
and indifferent to afford support to agitators and
reformers.</p>

<span class="caption">PRINCESS ISABEL IN 1889.</span>
</div>

<p>Agriculture, commerce, and industry advanced
only slowly during the first eight years of Pedro's
rule. The country was getting ready for the activity
which followed. Great Britain's efforts to induce
the Brazilian government to carry out its treaty
obligations for the suppression of the slave-trade
had been futile. In 1845 the British Parliament
passed the Aberdeen Bill, which authorised British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
men-of-war to capture slavers even in territorial
waters. This measure was especially directed at
Brazil, whose coast had become practically the sole
market for the horrible traffic. The bill did not immediately
effect its purpose, and the slavers made
the most of the opportunity. In 1848 over sixty
thousand negroes were imported into Brazil. Immigration
from Europe had practically ceased with
the expulsion of Pedro I. and the anti-foreign demonstrations
of the Regency, but it now slowly
began again. In 1843 Dom Pedro, being then not
quite eighteen years old, was married by proxy to
Theresina Christina, daughter of Francis, King of
Naples. There is a tradition that the Emperor
turned his back when he saw his bride's face. Nevertheless,
he made her a good husband. Their two
boys died in infancy, but in 1846 Isabel was born,
who still survives and lives in Paris with her husband,
a grandson of Louis Philippe, and with her
three sons, the eldest of whom is named for his
grandfather and was twenty-seven years old in 1902.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>EVENTS OF 1849 TO 1864</h3>


<p>After the final pacification of the country prosperity
came with a rush. In the six years
from 1849 to 1856 foreign commerce more than
doubled. The circulating medium was brought to
a sound basis. Coffee had doubled in value by 1850,
and its culture was rapidly extended. The profits
of sugar-raising had not risen in the same proportion,
and Rio, S&atilde;o Paulo, and Minas drew slaves
from the northern provinces. The decline of mining
in the late years of the eighteenth century and the
profitableness of sugar and tobacco during the great
wars had made Maranh&atilde;o, Pernambuco, and Bahia
overshadow the South for a time, but now the tide
turned the other way. Brazil's drift has ever since
been to the South.</p>

<p>The Emperor and government followed an enlightened
and vigorous progressive commercial policy.
The subjects of internal communication, of colonisation,
of better steamship facilities, of the opening
of public lands to settlement, of public instruction,
of liberal treatment to foreigners, and of administra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>tive
and financial reforms were taken up intelligently.
So far as the government was concerned the suspicious
and jealous exclusive policy was abandoned,
and large amounts of foreign capital began to be
invested in commercial houses, preparing the way
for the great government loans and railroad building
soon to come. The British had the lion's share of
the importing and the Americans of the carrying
trade.</p>

<p>The history of Brazil for the next few decades
contains examples of devotion, of high-mindedness,
and of great capacities worthily employed, of which
any country might well be proud. The higher
officials as a rule left office poorer than they had
entered it. However, in the lower ranks of the
magistracy and the government departments there
was much to be desired. The public service became
more and more the one career sought by young
men of ability. The mercantile and property-owning
classes in general kept out of politics. Only
the landowning and slaveholding aristocracy owed
a nominal allegiance to the two parties whose active
members were the officeholders or those who
hoped to become officeholders. The most promising
and prominent young men were selected from
the graduates of the universities, placed in the magistracy,
thence to be promoted to the Chamber of
Deputies, and to be governors of provinces. The
final goal was a nomination to the senate, where,
from the dignified security of a life position, the
successful Brazilian politician watched the struggles
of those below him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus-480.jpg" width="800" height="573" alt="PAMPAS OF THE RIO GRANDE." title="" />
<span class="caption">PAMPAS OF THE RIO GRANDE.</span>
</div>

<p>The bright young magistrates were preoccupied
with their own ambitions and were not responsible
to the people of the localities they happened to be
governing for the moment. Real local interests
were not studied. Those who reached the highest
positions applied their well-trained minds to larger
problems, but their work was too much from above
down&mdash;they produced admirable reports and framed
admirable laws, but among the lazy magistracy and
indifferent people the energy to put them into effect
was too often wanting. But the level of political
well-being rose noticeably, though fitfully. The
Brazil of 1850 had progressed far beyond the Brazil
of colonial times. Liberty of speech was unquestioned
and unquestionable; arbitrary imprisonment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
had died out; the grosser forms of tyranny had
vanished; property rights and the administration of
civil justice had much improved. Judges no longer
openly received presents from litigants, though the
nation had not risen to the conception of a judiciary
independent of the executive.</p>

<p>In 1850 the Emperor chose a new Conservative
Cabinet, which proved the most efficient the country
had known. Its first great act was to abolish the
slave trade.</p>

<p>The year 1850 is also memorable as that in which
the yellow fever began those terrible ravages on
the Brazilian coast which have never since entirely
ceased. The first epidemic is said to have been the
worst which ever visited Rio. Two hundred persons
fell sick daily, and the wealthier classes were
especially attacked. Among the victims was the
great statesman, Bernardo de Vasconcellos, and
many deputies, senators, and diplomatic representatives.
Congress adjourned in terror. In the earlier
epidemics the citizens of Rio were just as susceptible
as foreigners. Later, however, they acquired a relative
immunity&mdash;an immunity which is not shared by
Brazilians who have lived in non-infected districts.</p>

<p>Brazil and Argentina had agreed in 1828 that
Uruguay should be an independent and neutral
buffer state between them. But the Buenos Aireans
never forgot that for geographical and historical
reasons Uruguay naturally belonged to them.
Rosas, the Argentine dictator, assisted the Oribe
faction, which openly advocated entering the confederation,
while the Rio Grande Brazilians who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
owned much property on the Uruguayan side of the
border aided the Rivera faction.</p>

<p>To protect the property interests of its citizens
and prevent Rosas from conquering Uruguay the
Brazilian government quietly made military preparations
and formed an alliance with the Rivera party
and with Urquiza, the ruler of the province of Entre
Rios, to which the dictator of Paraguay and the
president of Bolivia gave a passive adhesion. It
amounted to a coalition to forestall Rosas's plan of
uniting the whole of the old Viceroyalty and the
Plate valley under his rule. Brazil was virtually
the instigator of a combination of the weaker Spanish-American
states against the strongest one.</p>

<p>Urquiza crossed the Uruguay, and with the aid of
the Brazilian troops made short work of Oribe's
army, which was besieging Rivera in Montevideo.
Rosas responded with a declaration of war and
began collecting a formidable army. Urquiza resolved
to carry the war to the gates of Buenos
Aires. The allies gathered in camp on the left bank
of the Paran&aacute;, a hundred miles above Rosario, a
great army which numbered four thousand Brazilians,
eighteen thousand Argentines, mostly from
the half-Indian provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes,
and a contingent of Uruguayans. A Brazilian
fleet under Admiral Grenfell had penetrated up
the Paran&aacute; and protected their crossing of the great
river. On the 17th of December they got safely
over the Paran&aacute;, and out of the low country of
Entre Rios on to the dry pampas of the right bank.
Thence they marched down on Buenos Aires, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
Rosas was awaiting them. On the 3rd of February,
1852, he gave them battle in the suburbs of that
city. He was completely defeated and fled to England.</p>

<p>Brazil found herself in a peculiarly advantageous
situation. The war had cost her little in money or
men. Buenos Aires might no longer hope to dominate
the other Argentine provinces, and seemed likely
to offer small resistance to the unified and centralised
empire. Uruguay's independence of Buenos Aires,
and Brazil's preponderance in Montevideo were assured.
The Rio Grandenses flocked over the border,
bought large amounts of property, and enjoyed
peculiar privileges, while the Uruguayan government
accepted subsidies from that of Brazil.</p>

<p>The country's commercial development continued
even more rapidly after the war. In 1853 the Bank of
Brazil was authorised to issue circulating notes, and
the expansion of credit stimulated business. The
same year the Conservative ministry, which had so
brilliantly governed the nation since 1848, was forced
to resign on account of the constant interference by
the Emperor. It was replaced by the "Conciliation
Cabinet"&mdash;whose chief, the Marquis of Paran&aacute;,
adopted the policy of admitting Liberals to administrative
positions. He remained in power until
1858, and his name will always be associated with
one of the most prosperous epochs in Brazilian history.
The first railway systems were inaugurated;
the receipts of the treasury grew fifty per cent.;
European immigration amounted to twenty thousand
a year; private wealth and luxury increased;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
and numerous theatres, balls, and social reunions furnished
an indication of the rise of the level of culture.</p>

<p>One of Brazil's reasons for entering on the war
against Rosas was to open up the navigation of the
Paraguay, Paran&aacute;, and Uruguay, upon which she
depended for access to a large part of her territory.
The treaties made at the conclusion of the war
assured, against her protest, free navigation to all
nations. Brazil has intermittently attempted to
confine the navigation of the international rivers
of South America to the nations having territory
on their banks.</p>

<p>Paran&aacute;'s "conciliation" policy seems to have
suited the Emperor very well, although it tended to
hamper the development of two great parties in
clearly defined opposition to each other. The elections
came more and more under the control of the
bureaucracy and were mere ratifications of selections
made by the ministers. Congress lost rather than
gained in influence, and the whole system became
steadily more centripetal.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD MARKET IN S&Atilde;O PAULO.</span>
</div>

<p>From 1849 the country had been having prosperous
times, but in 1856 the inevitable commercial
crisis came. Prosperity had brought about extravagances
in governmental administration; the budgets
showed deficits; foreign loans were resorted to; the
currency fluctuated violently. Brazil entered upon
seven lean years, during which foreign trade remained
stationary, the revenues increased only at
the cost of heavy impositions, and the public debt
grew. With the death of the Marquis of Paran&aacute; in
1858 the regular Conservatives returned to power.
He had been the dominant figure in politics since
the Regency, and his personal prestige and the confidence
the Emperor reposed in him had had much to
do with holding the government together during the
panic. But the new ministry could not make headway
against the difficulties. A new currency law
was necessary, but the mercantile and speculating
classes bitterly opposed the rigid measures proposed
by successive Cabinets. Paran&aacute;'s neutral policy had
given the opposition a hold in some of the most
important provinces, and the following elections
showed a vast increase in the number of Liberals
and of dissident Conservatives. Conservative Cabinets
succeeded each other rapidly from 1858 to 1862.
The opposition to a contraction of the currency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
grew in force, and the dissidents and Liberals finally
obtained a majority. The Emperor at last called
upon the leader of the dissident Conservatives&mdash;Zacarias&mdash;to
form a government. But he was as
powerless as his predecessors, and as a last resort the
Emperor temporarily gave up the effort to govern
after the English system, and selected a Cabinet outside
of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>The elections of 1863 resulted in a complete defeat
of the Conservatives, but the victorious Liberals did
not need to pass any radical currency legislation.
Hard times had disappeared by the operation of
natural law. The bank-notes approached par and
the budgets nearly balanced. With 1864 the country
entered upon a new era of prosperity. The production
of coffee had doubled from 1840 to 1851,
and then had remained stationary. But with the
cessation of the Civil War in the United States an
era of high prices was inaugurated which coincided
with Brazil's financial rehabilitation, and stimulated
planting. Although real activity in the building of
railroads did not begin until after the Paraguayan
war, four short lines had been started before 1862.
The years of peace and order had disaccustomed
the people to the thought of violence, and a steady
advance had been made toward government by law.
The highly educated statesmen placed by the Emperor
at the head of affairs understood the most
important principles of good government and tried
conscientiously to put them in practice. In transportation,
banking, posts, and telegraphs, commercial
methods, etc., the improvements of modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
civilisation were easily introduced, though in agriculture
the indolence of proprietors and the apathetic
ignorance of the slaves prevented any rapid advance.</p>

<p>On the whole, Brazil had made greater political and
industrial progress when the Paraguayan war broke
out than any other South American country, though
grave vices remained to hamper her further development.
The mass of the people were apathetic and
ignorant; slavery tended to discredit industrious
habits, at best so difficult to maintain in the tropics;
the upper classes showed little interest in or aptitude
for commercial matters: commerce, banking, railroads,
mining, and engineering prospered only where
foreigners personally engaged in them. The people
themselves, in spite of the enlightenment of the
educated classes, showed little initiative or energy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE PARAGUAYAN WAR</h3>


<p>Brazilian statesmen might well have been
pardoned if, in 1865, they had claimed for their
country the hegemony of South America. The result
of the war against Rosas had been brilliant; the
Argentine had only just emerged from half a century
of civil war; Uruguay was almost a Brazilian protectorate;
Brazil's internal condition was settled; in
concentration of power, as well as in wealth, population,
and extent, she was at the head of the
continent. With the republics on the west she
maintained good relations, while all the time she
was firmly pressing her territorial claims on toward
the foot of the Andes. She even attempted to control
the navigation of the great waterways of South
America.</p>

<span class="caption">GOVERNOR'S PALACE IN S&Atilde;O PAULO.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1863, Flor&eacute;s, a defeated chief, returned from
Buenos Aires and set up the standard of revolt in
Uruguay. Penetrating as far as the Brazilian border
he received assistance, and Aguirre, the Montevidean
president, protested. At the same time the
latter ruler refused to settle certain claims on behalf
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>of Brazilian citizens which the Rio government had
been pressing. The Emperor decided to intervene
and help Flor&eacute;s, and thereupon sent a man-of-war
up the Uruguay River, which blockaded a port and
destroyed Uruguayan public property. Aguirre declared
war, and Brazil and Flor&eacute;s in alliance besieged
and took the principal towns in western Uruguay.
The Argentine received satisfactory assurances and
remained neutral.</p>

<p>This high-handed adjustment of Uruguayan affairs
furnished a pretext to the Paraguayan dictator,
Francisco Lopez, to intervene in his turn. Under
a line of vigorous dictators who concentrated all the
forces of the nation into their own hands, that
country had become menacing to the loosely organised
Argentine Republic. Lopez even thought he
was strong enough to bid defiance to Brazil. The
tyrant was, in fact, an impossible neighbour for the
two more progressive and civilised powers. For
years he had been preparing for war and at the moment
was stronger in a military way than either of
his bulky neighbours. He hated both Argentines
and Brazilians, and his people had been taught to
despise the courage of the latter. Though Brazil's
intervention in Uruguay was a matter in which he
had an interest, a dignified protest would have obtained
ample assurances that the latter's independence
would be respected, for there is no evidence
that the imperial government intended to do anything
more than to replace its enemy Aguirre by the
friendly Flor&eacute;s. But the arrogant tyrant wanted to
draw the world's attention to himself. He appre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>ciated
how difficult it would be for Brazil to send an
army against him and how much more difficult it
would be to maintain one, and he also knew that
she was unprepared to undertake a serious war on
foreign soil.</p>

<p>Without any declaration of war, in the fall of 1864
he seized a Brazilian steamer which was making its
regular trip up the Paraguay River to Matto Grosso.
The crew were imprisoned, and only the intervention
of the American minister saved the lives of the
Brazilian minister and his family. This outrage left
Brazil no alternative. Lopez followed up the seizure
of the boat by an expedition up the Paraguay River
against Matto Grosso, and easily conquered the principal
southern settlements in that province.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the Argentine made
her attitude of decisive importance to both belligerents.
Uruguay and the southern provinces of Brazil
were separated from Paraguay by the Argentine
provinces of Corrientes and the Missions. Argentina
had favoured Flor&eacute;s's pretensions, and Lopez
was so obnoxious that the secret sympathies of Buenos
Aires were with Brazil. Further than neutrality,
Mitre, then president of Argentina, would not go.
He declared that no permission would be given
either belligerent to cross Argentine territory with
troops. Lopez was made desperately angry at this
refusal; he thought he could count on the alliance
and support of Urquiza, the virtually independent
ruler of the province of Entre Rios and Mitre's
enemy, and seems to have believed that he might
as well finish up with both Argentina and Brazil at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
one sitting. In March, 1865, he deliberately declared
war on the Argentine, and eighteen thousand
Paraguayan troops crossed the Paran&aacute; and began
offensive operations against Corrientes, Uruguay,
and Brazil.</p>

<p>Instead of rising against Mitre, Urquiza declared
himself against the Paraguayan dictator, and as his
province of Entre Rios controlled access to Paraguay
by water, Lopez found that the only result of his
rash act was to open up the way by which his
enemies could most conveniently reach him. On
the first of May, 1865, a formal alliance was made
between Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Mitre
was agreed upon as commander-in-chief; the allies
promised not to lay down their arms until Lopez
should be overthrown and expelled from Paraguay;
and pledges were given to respect Paraguay's
independence. Of the three allies Brazil was the
only one which could be expected to give its whole
force. Flor&eacute;s could only answer for the colorado
faction of Uruguay. Argentina did not represent
much more than Buenos Aires. Entre Rios was
Urquiza's, and the other outside provinces had
no great interest in the result. Nevertheless, the
alliance was very advantageous to Brazil. It would
have been well-nigh impossible to wage a successful
war against an enemy shut up in the middle
of the continent, and accessible only by a three-months'
march across nearly impassable country, or
by tedious navigation up a single river running
through a third country, and where an army would
have to be disembarked direct from ships on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
enemy's soil. The adhesion of Argentina made an
aggressive war possible, and the event proved how
hopeless would have been a campaign by Brazil
alone.</p>

<p>The story of the military operations belongs to
the history of Paraguay, and only those events
which bore a direct relation to internal affairs in
Brazil will be mentioned here. The successful naval
battle of Riachuelo, on the Paran&aacute;, just below the
southern end of Paraguayan territory, in June, 1865,
aroused great enthusiasm in Brazil. National feeling
was hardly cooled by the news which soon followed
of a Paraguayan invasion of Rio Grande, and
rose again with the defeat of that invasion. Brazil's
regular army numbered less than fifteen thousand
men before the war, but at the Emperor's call fifty-seven
battalions of volunteers were organised in the
fall of 1865. A loan of five million pounds was
arranged in London, and no expense was spared in
fitting out the army and in strengthening the fleet.
By the end of the war Brazil had eighty-five ships,
not counting transports, of which thirteen were
ironclads. The voyage from Rio de Janeiro to
Paraguay takes a month, and the transportation of
men and material was tedious and extremely expensive.
The government resorted to the issue of paper
money, and outraged the feelings of the financial
world by compelling the Bank of Brazil to give up
the reserve it was maintaining for the redemption of
its note issues. The premium on gold rose and the
currency fluctuated wildly, although general trade
continued to boom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>In September, 1865, the Paraguayan army which
had invaded Rio Grande was captured in a body, and
peace was confidently expected. Lopez, however,
decided to fight it out to the bitter end, and it was
April, 1866, before the allies could gain a foothold
on Paraguayan soil. For the next six months Brazil
was sickened with accounts of desperately bloody
and indecisive battles, of which the last was an
awful repulse before Curupayty. For more than a
year thereafter the allies lay motionless in their
camps in the south-western corner of Paraguay,
while the cholera carried off thousands.</p>

<p>Though his favourite general, Marshal Caxias,
was a Conservative, and not on good terms with the
Liberal Cabinet, the Emperor insisted that he be
sent to take command. Re-enforcements were vigorously
recruited from all over the empire, and in
July, 1867, the cautious Caxias began a slow advance.
The expenses were mounting up to sixty
millions a year; the country chafed at the delays,
Caxias quarrelled with the ministers. In July, 1868,
the Emperor dismissed them on his own responsibility,
and, though the Liberals had still a large majority
in the Chamber, called in a Conservative Cabinet.
On this occasion the Emperor's pressure was not
influential enough to change a minority into a
majority, and the Chamber preferred dissolution to
submission. Meanwhile Caxias had at last begun
to win victories. The very month of the fall of the
Liberals he took the great fortress of Humait&aacute;, which
guarded the passage up the Paraguay, and Lopez
retreated to the neighbourhood of his capital ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>companied
by almost all the surviving Paraguayans.
In November Caxias cleverly outflanked him and
taking him in the rear compelled him to fight outside
of his trenches until hardly any Paraguayans
were left. By the beginning of 1869 Lopez was a
fugitive, the Brazilians were in possession of Asuncion,
and the war was over except for pursuing Lopez
and the few starving soldiers who followed him
through the woods.</p>

<span class="caption">HOSPITAL AND OLD CHURCH AT PORTO ALEGRE.</span>
</div>

<p>Elections were held in March, but it was not
worth while for the Liberals to make even the show
of a contest. The Liberal leaders issued a manifesto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
declining to take any part, and, censuring the Emperor
for calling the Conservatives to power against
the known wishes of the majority of a legally elected
Chamber, announced that they would respect the
laws and would confine themselves to a non-parliamentary
propagation of the doctrines of anti-absolutism,
liberalism, and emancipation. From this
time dates the systematic propaganda for the republic.
The war ended with the Emperor's son-in-law
hunting down the Paraguayan bands. In March,
1870, Lopez was caught with the last few hundred
men who remained faithful and speared by a common
soldier as he tried to escape through the woods.</p>

<p>The war had cost Brazil three hundred million
dollars and over fifty thousand lives. She had
gained no substantial result except assuring the
safety of Matto Grosso and securing the free navigation
of the Paraguay. The Emperor did not attempt
to use his victory by establishing a hegemony over
South America. Rather did the end of the Paraguayan
war mark the beginning of a policy of systematic
abstention from intermeddling with outside
matters. Paraguay and Uruguay were left in full
enjoyment of their independence, and the Argentine
then began her marvellous industrial progress and
political consolidation. The Plate republics reaped
the benefits of the war, while Brazil bore its heaviest
burdens. Most of the Argentine provinces had
taken little part except to furnish provisions and
horses at high prices, and the opening up of Paraguay
redounded to the benefit of Buenos Aires and
Montevideo&mdash;not to that of Rio.  No spirit of im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>perialism
spread among the Brazilian people, though
they are still proud of the record their soldiers and
sailors then made. Their bravery in field fighting
and the assault of fortified places was proved beyond
question, no matter how poorly they may have been
commanded, and how deficient their organisation.
The history of no war contains more examples of
heroic and hopeless charges, or stories of more
desperate hand-to-hand fighting. But a successful
battle was followed by torpor; Brazilian tenacity
was shown in the patience with which defeats were
sustained, and in holding on month after month in
camp, rotting in the miasmatic swamps, rather than
in pursuing advantages obtained in the field.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>REPUBLICANISM AND EMANCIPATION</h3>


<p>From 1808 to 1837 the tendency had been in the
direction of democracy and decentralisation.
Then the tide turned and from 1837 to the Paraguayan
war the central government grew stronger
and federalism weaker. The power of the Emperor
reached its apogee in 1870. The senators had been
personally selected by him and he could count
on their gratitude and friendship. Deputies were
elected indirectly by electors chosen by a suffrage
nominally universal, but the elections&mdash;primary and
secondary&mdash;were mere farces, absolutely controlled
by the ministry which happened to be in power.
The local governors and magistrates, the officers of
the national guard, and the police, all dependent
on the central government for their positions, formed
a machine against which opposition was useless. If
intimidation was not sufficient, the baldest frauds
were shamelessly resorted to&mdash;false polling lists,
manufactured returns, and the seating of contestants
by the majority in the Chamber or the returning
boards. Of this system the Emperor was the real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
beneficiary, for the Cabinets held at his pleasure,
and if the majority of a Chamber did not sustain a
ministry which he desired to keep in power, all he
had to do was to order a dissolution. But this
hybrid system contained in itself the elements of
sure decay. The Emperor was no arbitrary despot
and neither wished nor would he have been able to
govern in complete defiance of public opinion. On
the other hand, the system afforded no sure method
of ascertaining public opinion nor of throwing a
proper responsibility upon well-organised political
parties.</p>

<p>With the close of the Paraguayan war a series of
movements began which ended twenty years later
with the overthrow of the empire. Brazil's history
during those twenty years is an account of the republican
propaganda, the abolition movement, the
attempt to reform the elections, the religious agitation,
the growth of positivist doctrines, the demand
for economic independence by the great provinces,
and finally the infiltration of liberalism and insubordination
into the army. This evolution, however,
affected principally the educated classes. The
masses of the people were and still remain largely
indifferent to the march of public events.</p>

<p>Commerce and industry continued to expand
throughout the Paraguayan war.  From 1865 to
1872  the annual revenues doubled, and though in
1868 the emissions of paper money had reduced its
value one-half, it steadily rose thereafter until in
1873  it again reached par. Just after the war the
budget balanced, and the production of coffee rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
one-half. But with relief from financial pressure
the Conservative ministers became extravagant,
and when the great world panic of 1873 came both
government and country were badly caught. A
foreign loan of five millions sterling made in 1875
was not enough to meet the mounting deficits. In
1878 new issues of paper money were resorted to,
and exchange dropped, remaining below par for ten
years in spite of a subsequent doubling of coffee
production and a great increase in the value of exports.
Population, however, which had increased
from five to ten millions from 1840 to 1870, in the
next twenty years mounted to fifteen millions.</p>

<span class="caption">BRIDGE AT MENDANHA.</span>
</div>

<p>The suppression of the slave trade by the Aber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>deen
Act and the Queiroz law made it probable
that the institution itself would ultimately disappear.
Brazilian character and customs had always stimulated
voluntary emancipation, and in Brazil the
negro does not reproduce as rapidly as the white.
In 1856 the slaves numbered two millions and a half,
being nearly forty per cent. of the population, but
in 1873 their number had fallen to 1,584,000, or
only sixteen per cent. The institution was, however,
socially and politically very strong. Slaves
furnished nearly all the labour employed in the production
of staple exports, and it was believed that
emancipation would be followed by agricultural collapse.
But the Emperor was too enlightened a
Christian and too susceptible to the good opinion of
the civilised world not be at heart an abolitionist.
However, it was only at the height of his influence
that he deemed it wise to force the consideration of
abolition on the reluctant nation. Agitation had
begun modestly in 1864; in 1866 gradual emancipation
was seriously proposed, but the breaking out
of the war caused the matter to be adjourned. In
1869 Joaquim Nabuco, father of the present Brazilian
minister to Great Britain, succeeded in virtually
committing the Liberal party to emancipation.
With the return of peace the question was taken up
vigorously. The reactionary Conservative Cabinet
resigned rather than be an instrument of the Emperor's
wishes as to emancipation, and Pimenta
Bueno was appointed Prime Minister for the especial
purpose of getting a law through Congress declaring
all children born thereafter free.  This statesman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
failed, but Rio Branco, father of the present Minister
for Foreign Affairs, was more successful. After a
bitter and prolonged parliamentary struggle, in which
Rio Branco used every weapon that his position gave
him in gaining and holding doubtful Congressional
votes, the law was passed in 1871. Thereafter all
children born of slave mothers were free, though
they remained bound to service until twenty-one.
The proprietors were also required to register all
their slaves. Under the influence of these measures
the number of slaves decreased with astonishing
rapidity&mdash;falling from 1,584,000 in 1873 to 743,000
in 1887.</p>

<p>Rio Branco's victory disrupted the Conservative
party, and after achieving it he was unable to hold
his majority together. The Chamber was dissolved,
and though the new one supported him half-heartedly
the old line Conservatives had become deeply dissatisfied
with the radical tendencies of the government
and the Emperor. Public men of all parties
awoke to realisation of the inconsistency between
the constitution and the Emperor's personal power.
Not much was said in the Chamber, but outside the
republican propaganda assumed an active form, and
the conviction fast crystallised that the empire could
not last for many years. A republican press came
into existence and a republican party was organised
under the leadership of Saldanha Marinho, an able
lawyer of Rio. Republican societies were formed
in all the centres of population, but there was no
thought of armed revolution. There is, indeed, no
evidence that the Emperor ever opposed the repub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>lican
propaganda, though occasionally he detached
some of its able members by promotions to office.</p>

<span class="caption">CITY OF OURO PRETO.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
</div>

<p>In 1873, 1874, and 1875 the question which most
absorbed public attention was the imprisonment of
the bishops of Par&aacute; and Pernambuco by the civil
authorities. The lower ranks of the priesthood
were uneducated, and real interest in religion had
largely been confined to women and the lower
classes. With the growth of liberal ideas among
the laity the Church awoke to the necessity of a reformation.
These two bishops were leaders in this
counter-movement, and they selected the Masonic
Lodges as a point of attack. In spite of the nominal
prohibition of the Church, Free-Masonry had
been permitted in Brazil since 1821, and the lodges
had become mere social clubs and philanthropic societies.
Free-Masons were members of those semi-religious
brotherhoods which take charge of local
church feasts and constitute the most important
link between the lay and spiritual worlds in Brazilian
communities. The two militant bishops ordered
that the brotherhoods should expel their Masonic
members or suffer the penalty of losing their right
to use the church edifices. Where these orders were
not obeyed interdicts were laid. The progressive
element and the magistracy took the side of the
Masons, but the bishops were not without their
supporters. The government insisted that the
obnoxious interdicts be withdrawn: the bishops
refused to yield, and were prosecuted in the civil
courts and sent to prison. The Princess Isabel was
believed to be on the priests' side, and while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
excitement gradually died out and things went on
as before, a wider breach than ever had been created
between the progressive and conservative classes.
Like the slave-owners devout Catholics now felt
that they could no longer depend on the imperial
system to protect them against the rising tide of
radicalism.</p>

<p>The financial difficulties growing out of the great
panic drove Rio Branco from power in 1875, and a
succession of Conservative Cabinets struggled along
until 1878. The question of electoral reform came
to the front, for every one was sick of the absurd
system in vogue, and the leaders of both the historical
parties hoped for great things from a radical
change. The Emperor was opposed to giving up
the indirect method of voting, but was anxious to try
some lesser reforms. On his return from the United
States and Europe in 1877 he virtually instructed
the Cabinet to put through a bill drawn after his
suggestions, but the Prime Minister resigned because
the Emperor insisted that the change could not be
made by an ordinary statute, but must go through
the tedious process of an amendment to the constitution.
The Emperor called in a Liberal Cabinet
and a new Chamber was elected.</p>

<p>The Liberal ministry continued in power until
1880, and then fell, partly because it had lost its hold
with the Liberal majority, and partly because of the
riots in Rio over the street-car tax. A law had been
passed compelling each passenger to pay a cent in
addition to the regular fare. The people refused,
burned the cars, cut the harness in pieces, threw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
conductors off, and fought the police until the business
of the city was brought to a standstill. The
Emperor called upon a cool and experienced politician,
Jos&eacute; Antonio Saraiva. But the latter refused
to take office unless he should be allowed to push
through the election bill in the form of an ordinary
law. Right here the Emperor suffered a great defeat.
He thought himself obliged to yield, and the
vigorous minister at once secured the passage of a
radical law which completely transformed the electoral
system. Suffrage was confined to the educated
and property-holding classes, but the electors voted
directly for deputies, and the country was divided
into districts each of which chose a single deputy.
The electoral body was now permanent, and each
deputy was responsible to a definite constituency.
Saraiva resigned the moment his bill was enacted
into law, and every precaution was taken to ensure
that the election of 1881 should be free from any
suspicion of official pressure. The result was a
revelation to the small-bore politicians of the old
r&eacute;gime. One hundred and fifty thousand voters
registered out of an adult male population of about
three millions, and ninety-six thousand voted. The
new members were divided nearly equally between
the two historical parties&mdash;the Liberals getting sixty-eight
and the Conservatives fifty-four. Two ministers
were defeated for re-election and many of the
contests were decided by small majorities. In subsequent
elections the Saraiva law proved not to be
so effective, and since it is not in the Latin nature
to be satisfied with gradual improvement, the liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
movement, of which the electoral law was a symptom,
swept on with increasing violence until the
beneficent law was uprooted along with the mistaken
system on which it had been painfully grafted.</p>

<p>As soon as electoral reform was out of the way
abolition became once more the dominant question
in Brazilian politics. Though the majority of Liberals
were abolitionists and the doctrine was one of
the official principles of the party, the various Liberal
Cabinets which succeeded each other from 1881 to
1884 managed to dodge the dangerous issue. Finally
the Dantas ministry faced it squarely. A bill
was introduced prohibiting the sale of slaves, establishing
an emancipation fund, and freeing slaves as
fast as they reached the age of sixty. A terrific
parliamentary battle followed and the project was
defeated by only seven votes&mdash;forty-eight Liberals
and four Conservatives voting for it, and seventeen
Liberals and forty-two Conservatives against. The
Emperor dissolved the Chamber and the excitement
over abolition became national. The abolitionists subsidised
newspapers, held public meetings, and marched
through the streets in procession carrying pictures
representing the torturing of slaves. No means were
spared which might aid to rouse the national conscience.
The negroes were advised to revolt, and
assistance was openly promised to them. The elections
of 1884 were violently contested, instead of
being free from fraud and protest like those of 1881.
Nor did the government so conscientiously abstain
from interference. Nevertheless the Chamber elected
did not differ materially in its composition from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
which had preceded it. Sixty-five of the one hundred
and twenty members of the new House were
Liberals, but of these fifteen were opposed to abolition.
For the first time avowed republican members
were elected&mdash;three being returned, and two of
them came from S&atilde;o Paulo&mdash;Prudente Moraes and
Campos Salles, the first two Brazilians to hold office
avowedly as republicans and who reaped their reward
by becoming two decades later the first two
civil presidents of the republic. No election was
ever held in Brazil which was so earnestly contested
and which constituted so genuine an expression of
the wishes of the people. Nevertheless, on the main
question&mdash;that of abolition&mdash;the result was apparently
a drawn battle.</p>

<p>With the meeting of the Chamber in 1885 the agitation
broke out afresh. The crowds on the Rio
streets hissed anti-emancipation deputies, and there
was a bitter fight for the control of the organisation
of the Chamber. It was soon evident that the Dantas
ministry could not force abolition through, and
it resigned. Saraiva was called in and he skilfully
arranged a compromise. With the aid of Conservative
votes he passed a bill for gradual and compensated
emancipation. This done, he resigned. The
Liberal party was disorganised and dissatisfied with
him, and he did not deem it worth his while to try
and hold it together. The quarrelling Liberal majority
was aghast when it was announced that a
Conservative Cabinet would take the reins of government.
The Emperor had begun to show decided
symptoms of a failure of his mental powers and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
ceasing to be a controlling factor in parliamentary
affairs. Saraiva's resignation further exacerbated
the Liberal leaders against the imperial system, and
at the same time continued to lose ground with the
slaveholders.</p>

<p>In the election the Liberals had no chance and
largely refrained from voting. The governing classes
shrank from the probable consequences of abolition;
the temper of the country seemed to have cooled;
the election reform of 1881 had not proven in practice
to be of much value. Though not so absolute
as before, the provincial governors resumed their
control of the result, and returns were made according
to the wishes of the ministry in power. One
hundred and three Conservatives received certificates
and only twenty-two Liberals, and most of the latter
came from the interior where official pressure
could least easily be applied. Not a republican
was returned, and the declared abolitionists had
almost disappeared, although every one knew that
the final blow to slavery could not long be deferred.</p>

<p>The new administration devoted itself to the
finances. Since 1871 the deficits had been continuous;
one sarcastic statesman said amid applause that
"the empire is the deficit." The issue of paper
money had been excessive. Better times began in
1886. A loan of six millions sterling was contracted
for on favourable terms; from forty per cent. below
par the currency rose to par in the succeeding three
years; imports and exports increased by leaps and
bounds; and the revenue grew seventy-five per cent.
in a single year. The production of coffee in S&atilde;o<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
Paulo, and of rubber in Par&aacute; and Amazonas reached
unprecedented figures; foreign immigration was subsidised
and a systematic propaganda to secure it
undertaken. From thirty thousand it ran up to
one hundred thousand a year, and the apprehensions
that emancipation would cause a dearth of
labour were largely quieted. Government subsidies
had kept up the building of railroads during the
years when the treasury was most embarrassed, and
naturally went on more rapidly when prosperity
came. When the Paraguayan war ended there
were only 450 miles of railroad in the country. In
the decade that followed 1450 were built, while
from 1880 to 1889 five hundred miles a year were
constructed.</p>

<p>The Conservative Prime Minister, Baron Cotegipe,
struggled hard through 1886 and 1887 to save the
remnants of slavery, but intelligent and unprejudiced
opinion was nearly unanimous for the entire abolition
of the disgraceful and barbarous institution.
Project after project was presented, each one more
radical than the last. The slaves began to flee from
the plantations. The army refused to aid the police
in capturing them. The poor old Emperor had gone
abroad, sick and failing, leaving Isabel as regent.
Her advisers, mostly priests and foreigners, told her
that the delay was endangering the dynasty. Cotegipe
resigned and John Alfredo was made Prime
Minister for the especial purpose of passing an
emancipation act. When Congress met in May,
1888, the speech from the throne announced that
the imperial programme was absolute, immediate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
and uncompensated emancipation. The prestige of
the Crown was sufficient to hush nearly all opposition.
Within eight days the law had passed both
Houses and been signed by the princess. The votes
against it were hardly numerous enough to be worth
counting. Only Cotegipe and a few devoted
monarchists stood in their places and read aloud
the handwriting on the wall, prophesying the
sure and speedy overthrow of a monarchy which
had thus cast off its surest and most natural supporters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE REVOLUTION&mdash;THE DICTATORSHIP&mdash;THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLIC</h3>


<p>Every intelligent man in Brazil had long recognised
the force of the permanently working
causes which were undermining the empire. Affonso
Celso, in 1902 considered the ablest advocate of
restoration, and the son of the last Prime Minister
of the empire, said, in 1886, from his place as national
deputy, that the empire maintained itself
only through the tolerance of its enemies. Neither
one of the two great parties of office-holders was
really monarchical, although the members of both
co-operated with the Emperor for the sake of the
patronage. But the Brazilian masses were too apathetic
to take any violent measures for the overthrow
of the worn-out institution without some
definite stimulus. This was furnished by the "military
question" in 1889.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<img src="images/illus-513.jpg" width="800" height="493" alt="MILITARY SCHOOL AT RIO JANEIRO." title="" />
<span class="caption">MILITARY SCHOOL AT RIO JANEIRO.</span>
</div>

<p>The teachings of Benjamin Constant, a professor
of the military school at Rio, had thoroughly impregnated
the younger officers of the army with
republican doctrine.  The officers were extremely
sensitive about their professional rights, and a spirit
of disaffection and insubordination was rife among
them. In 1886 there was great indignation in the
army because an officer, who had engaged in an undignified
newspaper controversy with a deputy, was
reprimanded by the secretary of war. A little later
another officer insisted on attacking through the press
a pension law advocated by the war department,
and his cause was taken up by the highest generals
with the Marshal Deodoro de Fonseca at their head.
This general was transferred from his post to a less
desirable one, and a new outburst of indignation
among the officers agitated army circles. The ministry
thought it best not to push the matter. In
1888 the bad feeling was further exacerbated by the
police arresting some officers for disorderly conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
in the streets. Again the army demanded satisfaction,
and again it was given. The favourite champion
of military dignity, Deodoro, was sent off to
Matto Grosso in the spring of 1889, and this was
taken as equivalent to a punishment for his activity
in maintaining the privileges of his profession.
Again the government thought it prudent to yield,
and he was allowed to return.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Emperor's health had grown
more feeble and the Princess Isabel was in power.
Herself unpopular, her parsimonious husband, the
Comte d'Eu, was bitterly disliked by most Brazilians.
The rumour gained credence that there was a plan to
have the sick Emperor resign in her favour. Though
the general feeling was that so long as the old man
lived and reigned he ought not to be disturbed, the
hot-headed republican officers were in no humour
to allow the princess to succeed to the throne. The
Conservative Cabinet had been met with a flat refusal
from the army when they ordered it to assist in
capturing fugitive slaves. The government's hand
was thus forced on the slavery question. John Alfredo's
Cabinet succeeded to Cotegipe's, but was
no happier in its dealings with the "military question."
The princess determined to call in the
Liberals, and their hard-headed leader, Ouro Preto,
was made Prime Minister. By many this was believed
to be a part of the plot for an abdication&mdash;that
the princess's friends wanted a strong man at
the head of affairs when the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> came.</p>

<p>Ouro Preto took charge of the government in
June, 1889, and shortly dissolved the Chamber after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
some bitter debates in which, for the first time in
Brazil, the cry of "Viva a Republica!" was heard on
the floor of Parliament. The new ministry had no
trouble in controlling the elections, and the new
Chamber that met in August was Liberal. Ouro
Preto felt strong enough to undertake to reduce the
malcontents to submission. He began by strengthening
the police force and the national guard, and
removing certain regiments from the capital. But
in September Deodoro returned from the remote
wilds of Matto Grosso and was received with great
demonstrations by his comrades. Secret meetings
of officers were held, and they pledged themselves
to sustain at all hazards the prestige of the military
class. Professor Constant, whose influence with the
younger officers was predominant, openly threatened
the ministry.</p>

<p>Early in November still another battalion was
ordered off from the capital to the north of Brazil,
and this was the immediate occasion for the formation
of a military conspiracy in which Professor Constant
and Deodoro were the original chiefs. They
determined to make an alliance with the republicans
and invited the co-operation of Quintino Bocayuva,
the chief of the militant republicans; of
Aristides Lobo, a republican editor of Rio; of
Glycerio, one of the republican chiefs in S&atilde;o Paulo;
of Ruy Barbosa, a great lawyer and editor, whose
attacks on the government had been very effective,
though he had not yet declared himself a republican;
and of Admiral Wandenkolk, who was expected
to secure the help of the navy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 643px;">
<img src="images/illus-516.jpg" width="643" height="600" alt="GENERAL BENJAMIN CONSTANT." title="" />
<span class="caption">GENERAL BENJAMIN CONSTANT.<br />
[From a woodcut.]</span>
</div>

<p>Deodoro and Constant could absolutely count
upon one brigade&mdash;the second&mdash;and were well assured
of the sympathy of all the regular forces in
Rio. Of course the plan could not be kept secret
from the government police, though the public
seems to have known nothing of the gravity of
what was going on. On the 14th of November, the
rumour spread that Deodoro and Constant would
be arrested. Orders had, in fact, been given for
the transfer of the disaffected brigade, and the ministers
were warned that it was preparing to resist.
That night the members of the Cabinet did not
sleep, and the morning found them still in anxious
council at the War Department, which faces the
great square of Rio. Constant had ridden out to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
the quarters of the Second Brigade, and early in the
morning led it to the square and drew up in front of
the War Department. Deodoro took command
of the insurgent troops, sending an officer to demand
the surrender of the ministers. Ouro Preto called
upon the adjutant-general, Floriano Peixoto, to
lead against the revolters the troops which were in
the general barracks. Floriano, after a little hesitation,
refused, and it is doubtful whether the troops
would have followed him had he consented. There
was no one to raise a hand for the ministers. They
surrendered and sent their resignations by telegraph
to the Emperor at Petropolis, twenty-five miles away
in the mountains. Their impression seems to have
been that the insurrection was simply a military mutiny
and that its object was solely to secure their
own downfall. But the fact that Constant, Bocayuva,
and others had been let into the inside enabled
these republicans to direct the movement so that a
permanent change in the form of government was
possible.</p>

<p>The troops in the barracks joined the Second
Brigade and all together marched through the centre
of the city cheering for the army, for Deodoro, and
the republic, amid the astonishment of the people,
most of whom knew nothing of any trouble until
they saw the parade. No resistance was offered,
and when the Emperor reached the city at three
o'clock in the afternoon the revolution was an accomplished
fact. The chiefs of the revolt had met
and organised a provisional government, naming
themselves ministers. They at once took possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
of their different departments and the public buildings.
A decree was issued announcing that henceforth
Brazil was to be a federal republic. The feeble
old Emperor was visited by a few friends, but there
was no one to raise a hand or strike a blow for him
or the dynasty. He himself would have shrunk
from being the occasion for the shedding of the
blood of any of his people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-518.jpg" width="600" height="749" alt="THE EMPRESS IN 1889." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE EMPRESS IN 1889.</span>
</div>

<p>When night fell, the provisional government formally
announced to the Emperor his deposition, and
that he and his family would be compelled to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
the country, though their lives would be guaranteed
and ample pecuniary provision be made for them.
The palace was guarded and no one allowed to
enter, though there were no indications of any
counter-revolution. The municipal council of the
city promptly gave its adherence to the new order
of things, and telegrams were coming in hourly from
the provinces to the effect that the latter were universally
satisfied and that republican sympathisers
were taking possession of the local governments
without opposition. During the night of the 16th,
the Emperor and his family were placed on board
ship and sent off to Lisbon.</p>

<p>The new government was, in fact, a centralised
military dictatorship, but the names of most of its
members were guarantees that the promises of the
establishment of a republic would be carried out.
In all the provinces the new situation was accepted
peacefully. The Rio government named new governors
by telegraph, and the imperial authorities
turned things over to them without resistance. Persons
known to have been advocates of republican
principles were preferred, and a rapid displacement
of the old governing classes ensued.</p>

<p>The provisional government continued in power
for fourteen months, and in that time promulgated
a series of laws touching almost every subject of
social or political interest. The provinces were organised
into states after the model of the members
of the North American Union; universal suffrage
was established; Church and State were entirely separated;
civil marriage was introduced; a new and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
humane criminal code was adopted; the judicial
system was reorganised after the American fashion;
and, in general, monarchical characteristics were
removed from the statutes, and the most modern
reforms enacted. A project for a constitution was
carefully framed, and this was submitted to a congress,
which had been summoned to meet early in
1891. This congress was composed of 205 deputies,
elected by states and not by districts, and of three
senators from each state. Acting as a constituent
assembly, it adopted with few modifications the
constitution proposed. The members of the constituent
congress had been almost universally selected
from among those who had been prominent in connection
with the new government, or had given it an
enthusiastic adhesion. With few exceptions, the
new constitution is a copy of that of the United
States. The only important difference is that in
Brazil the enactment of general civil and criminal
law is a federal and not a state attribute. The
revenues of the newly created states were made
much larger than those of the imperial provinces,
principally by transferring to them the duties on
exports.</p>

<p>Though the constitution of February 24, 1891,
nominally went into effect at once, as a matter of
fact the government continued military. Deodoro
was elected president, and Marshal Floriano Peixoto
vice-president, and the dictatorship was effective,
except so far as it was managed and controlled by
a few leaders who had power in the army, navy, or
financial world.  The provisional government had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
conceded to banks in every important centre of the
country the right to issue circulating notes. The
markets were flooded with money; credit was easy;
an extraordinary speculative boom set in; values
rose tremendously. The last years of the empire
had been prosperous and exchange had gone to par.
Within three years after the empire was overthrown,
the amount of paper money in circulation was more
than tripled, but though exchange had fallen tremendously,
no ill effects were yet apparent. The
nation was drunk with suddenly acquired wealth.
Companies of all sorts were granted government
concessions&mdash;railroad companies, mining companies,
harbour improvement companies, banks, factories,
and even sugar and coffee plantation companies.
The price of coffee and rubber was rising in gold,
while the cost of production was falling with the
depreciation of the currency. The flood of Italian
immigration which had been going to the Argentine
was largely diverted to Brazil. Rio, Par&aacute;, and S&atilde;o
Paulo were the centres of the prosperity. Business
men from the provinces swarmed into these cities,
and the fortunate owners of plantations emigrated
to Paris to spend their easily acquired wealth.</p>

<p>During 1891 and 1892 Deodoro became involved
in disputes with republican leaders. To these political
difficulties were added quarrels over the government
concessions which were expected to make
every one rich. Deodoro offended the moneyed
powers by not granting such concessions as freely
as was desired by many influential persons. Finally
Deodoro found that he could no longer count on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
majority in Congress, so he arbitrarily dissolved it.
But revolutions broke out in the different states
against the governors who stood by the dictator,
and he also found that he could not rely upon
the unquestioning support of the army. The navy
was decidedly disaffected. After some hesitation
he yielded to the signed demand of a powerful junta
and resigned in favour of the vice-president, whom
the speculators and promoters thought they could
easily control. They were grievously disappointed
in Floriano. The radical republicans found him
more to their liking than did the wealthier classes
and the bureaucrats. The navy has always been recruited
among the aristocrats and looked down upon
the army and soon developed a dislike for the plebeian
and illiterate president. An effort was made to
pass and put into effect a law expelling Floriano
from office before the expiration of the four-years'
term for which Deodoro and he had been elected,
but he flatly announced that he would serve out the
term to which he believed himself constitutionally
entitled.</p>

<p>In the meantime a rebellion had broken out in
Rio Grande do Sul against Julio de Castilhos, the
radical republican governor. Gaspar Silveira Martims,
the local leader of the old Liberal party, had
been banished, but from Montevideo he organised
the insurrection. The adherents of the two historical
imperial parties and the gauchos of the southern
part of the state joined the movement enthusiastically.
Presently the pampas were swept from one
end to the other by bands of federalists, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
dreaded leaders like Gomercindo Saraiva, a ranchman
from near the Uruguayan border. The republicans
stood firm, and Pinheiro Machado and
other gaucho chiefs showed that they, too, possessed
the fighting qualities which have always distinguished
the hard-riding, meat-eating Rio Grandenses.
With the aid of federal troops the republicans
had decidedly the upper hand, but the federalists
kept the field for three years, while the country was
harried and the most frightful destruction of life and
property took place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the intriguers against Floriano at Rio
took advantage of this formidable complication.
The mercantile classes, the Conservatives, the moderate
republicans, and those who regretted the empire
were opposed to him. The navy was ready to
revolt at any time. A number of powerful men had
bluffed Deodoro into resigning, and they thought
that they could easily do the same with Floriano. A
majority in Congress was against him and he seemed
to be almost isolated. But he had no thought of
yielding or withdrawing. His subsequent actions
show that he certainly was not actuated by any
vaulting personal ambition. His was rather the instinct
of a soldier who stands where he is and fights
to the last without reasoning why. The real crisis
in the establishment of the Republic had, in fact,
arrived. Floriano's overthrow would have meant
anarchy and disintegration, government by pronunciamento,
short-lived administrations established and
overthrown by military force.</p>

<p>Early in September, 1893, the entire navy, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
the lead of Admiral Mello, revolted. The guns of
the fleet commanded the harbour and seemed to
make the city untenable. Floriano acted with great
energy. The army stood by him and he recruited
vigorously. The fleet would not seriously bombard
the city, full of sympathisers with the revolt, and
Floriano held the fortifications around the bay so
that it was difficult for Mello to obtain supplies.
Though the European naval forces, which quickly
assembled, sympathised with the insurgents, they
could hardly give any efficient help so long as
Floriano held the capital. Mello hesitated about
attempting to establish a blockade. At first the
insurgents disclaimed any intention of re-establishing
the empire, but soon the revolt began to take on a
frankly monarchical character. The friends of the
old r&eacute;gime, however, nowhere showed the same
energy and conviction as the republicans who stood
by Floriano.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
<img src="images/illus-525.jpg" width="1024" height="638" alt="AMERICAN LEGATION NEAR RIO." title="" />
<span class="caption">AMERICAN LEGATION NEAR RIO.</span>
</div>

<p>In Rio harbour matters came to a stand. Neither
side could deal a decisive blow to the other, but in
the end Floriano and the land forces were sure to
win, because without a base of supplies the fleet
could not maintain itself indefinitely. It was necessary
for Mello to start a fire in the rear and to open
communication with the Rio Grande federalists.
He escaped through the harbour entrance with one
of his ironclads, and went to Santa Catharina, where
he established the seat of the revolutionary government.
Gomercindo Saraiva, the able federalist chief,
eluded the superior republican forces in the north of
Rio Grande and attempted an invasion of Santa Cath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>arina,
Paran&aacute;, and S&atilde;o Paulo, where it was hoped
that the monarchical plantation owners would rise.
But he was vigorously pursued and his forces defeated
and scattered. The failure of this daring
expedition was the death-knell of the revolt. Mello
returned to Rio and there his position fast became
untenable. The final crisis came with the refusal of
the American admiral to permit him to establish a
commercial blockade. This took away his last hope
of being able to coerce Floriano to terms. The
naval revolt collapsed in March, 1894: some of the
ironclads escaped from Rio harbour and fled to
Santa Catharina, where they were captured by the
republicans. The Rio Grande federalists kept up
a partisan warfare for a few months longer, but by
1895 they were completely stamped out.</p>

<p>Floriano was supreme, but instead of establishing
a permanent military dictatorship he declined to be
a candidate for re-election, and selected Prudente
Moraes as his successor for the term beginning in
1894. Prudente had been one of the two republican
deputies elected from S&atilde;o Paulo in 1886, and
had acted as president of the Constitutional Assembly
which framed the new constitution. Moderate
and conservative in his opinions and methods,
his selection was a recognition of the advisability of
civil government and an abandonment of the system
of military dictatorship. With his assumption of
office the Republic may be said to have been at last
definitely established.</p>

<p>The state governments were now functioning
regularly, and their governors soon began to assume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
a great importance in the political system. These
executives are selected by local cliques instead of
by the central government, as in imperial times;
their command of the police and state patronage
enables them to control elections, name their own
successors, and exercise a predominant influence in
the choice of deputies and senators to the national
Congress. They are the chief instruments through
which the president's control of politics is exercised.</p>

<p>The majority in Congress, composed of the leaders
of the republican movement, and known as the Federal
Republican party, supported Prudente in the
early part of his administration, but he was too liberal
to suit the Radicals in drawing into participation
in public affairs capable Brazilians of other antecedents.
This policy and the jealousies that always
arise in a dominant party brought about a rupture
between him and the leader of the House majority.
In the trial of strength which followed, the Federal
Republican party was split, and though the president
was victorious by a small margin, his position
became very precarious.</p>

<p>The Republic had started out on a scale of unprecedented
extravagance. The old provincial governments
had been given only the fragments from the
imperial table, but the republican constitution multiplied
the revenues of the new states many fold.
The issues of paper money, the high prices of coffee
and rubber, and the speculative boom gave both
state and federal government for a while plenty of
money to spend. The Union and the states vied
with each other in multiplying employees, in making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
loans, in spending money on public edifices, and in
building and guaranteeing railroads. The larger the
deficits grew the more paper money was issued, and
exchange fell with sickening rapidity. A larger and
larger proportion of the paper revenue had to be
devoted to the purchase of gold bills for the payment
of the interest on the foreign debt. The deficits increased
in geometrical progression. By 1895 signs
of the coming trouble were apparent, though the
business of the country was still prosperous. In
1896 came an outbreak of religious fanaticism in the
interior of Bahia, which grew into an armed revolt&mdash;small,
it is true, but which cost much money to
suppress. The necessity for retrenchment was evident;
railroad building was interrupted; schemes
to rehabilitate the currency were brought forward
and discussed.</p>

<p>The governments of the poorer states looked for
help to the impoverished federal treasury, and some
of the stronger states showed impatience at being
hampered by an unprofitable connection with their
weak sisters. The president was not on sympathetic
terms with the victorious Radicals in Rio Grande,
and the uncompromising republicans all over the
Union felt that they were not sufficiently favoured.
In the fall of 1897 an attempt was made in broad
daylight to assassinate Prudente, and prominent opposition
politicians were strongly suspected of complicity
in the plot. A state of siege was declared,
but the country remained quiet, and no serious opposition
was apparent when Prudente announced
that his support would be given to Campos Salles as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
his successor in office and presumably the continuer
of his policies.</p>

<p>A great drop in the price of coffee began, and
the financial situation of the government grew worse
and worse. Brazil grows about two-thirds of the
world's coffee and her crop was enormously increasing.
Consequently the production of coffee was
outrunning the world's consuming capacity. The
enormous profits of preceding years and the abundant
supply of good Italian labour had stimulated
planting beyond all reason. New and fertile districts
were opened up in the interior of S&atilde;o Paulo,
with which the older plantations of Rio and the
coast regions could not compete. The poorer districts
were reduced to poverty, while even the more
fertile could not hold their own.</p>

<p>In government finances the lowest point was
reached in 1898. The paper money had fallen to
seventy-nine per cent. below par and it had become
clearly impossible to continue payments on the
foreign debt. The last act of Prudente's administration
was to make an agreement by which the
foreign creditors consented to waive the receipt of
their interest for three years and the government
pledged itself to reduce the volume of paper currency
and to accumulate a fund for the resumption of
interest payments.</p>

<p>No contest was made against Campos Salles's election
in the spring of 1898. He took office finding
an empty treasury, a government without financial
credit, and the country in the midst of a severe
commercial crisis. He showed great shrewdness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
maintaining an ascendancy over the politicians and
controlling a majority in both branches of Congress,
and, through his minister of finance, relentlessly
followed the policy of contracting the currency and
increasing taxes. In 1901 the payment of interest
on the foreign debt was resumed, and though that
debt had been increased fifty million dollars the currency
had doubled in value and become relatively
stable. The state governments are more dependent
on the Union than in the days of their wealth; there
is little present danger of disintegration; no real
sentiment for the re-establishment of the empire
exists. The same habits of political subordination
which have kept Brazil together so long are increasing
rather than diminishing in force.</p>

<p>The commercial crisis and the high taxes have
created great discontent among merchants. Coffee-planters
and rubber-gatherers have still further suffered
by the rise of the currency. Immigration has
practically ceased, and there is little water left in
speculative enterprises. The great Bank of the Republic
failed in 1900, dragging down many industrial
concerns and ruining thousands of small investors,
and the government's connection with the bank
caused much scandal. Other banks, which had too
much extended their agricultural and industrial
credits, have also failed, and there is great want of
confidence among investors. However, capital is
slowly accumulating, and a healthful tendency toward
industrious habits and the employment of
reasonable and moderate methods in exploiting the
great untouched natural resources of the country is
evident.</p>

<p>Rodrigues Alves, the third civil president of the
Republic, was peaceably elected in the spring of
1902, and took his seat on November 15th, the thirteenth
anniversary of the Republic. Like both his
predecessors he is from S&atilde;o Paulo, and was virtually
named by his immediate predecessor. His policy
is expected to be the same as Campos Salles's&mdash;that
is, to keep expenses within revenue and to maintain
the political <i>status quo</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving out immigration, the Brazilian people
have shown a steady natural increase of nearly two
per cent. per annum during this century. The total
population has multiplied from less than three to
more than eighteen millions. Not a fiftieth part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
the territory is cultivated; its resources have never
been studied, much less developed; the positive
checks hardly exist; the preventive checks are yet
indefinitely remote. Modern altruism makes wars
of extermination unthinkable; the colonial experiences
of the last century have demonstrated that
races possessing a reasonably efficient industrial organisation
do not tend to disappear, even though
nations whose physical force is greater may reduce
them to political subordination. The Brazilians
have the additional advantage of inheriting directly
a European civilisation. They are too firmly established,
too numerous and prolific, and possess a too
highly organised and deeply rooted civilisation to be
in danger of expulsion or political absorption. Immense
immigration into South America is inevitable,
as soon as the pressure of population is strongly
felt in Western Europe and North America. This
may transform Brazil economically, but the new conditions
will have to fit themselves into the political
and social framework already in existence.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Nations</h3>

<p>In the story form the current of each National life
is distinctly indicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy
periods and episodes are presented for the
reader in their philosophical relation to each other
as well as to universal history.</p>

<p>It is the plan of the writers of the different volumes
to enter into the real life of the peoples, and to bring
them before the reader as they actually lived, labored,
and struggled&mdash;as they studied and wrote, and as
they amused themselves. In carrying out this plan,
the myths, with which the history of all lands begins,
are not overlooked, though they are carefully
distinguished from the actual history, so far as the
labors of the accepted historical authorities have
resulted in definite conclusions.</p>

<p>The subjects of the different volumes have been
planned to cover connecting and, as far as possible,
consecutive epochs or periods, so that the set when
completed will present in a comprehensive narrative
the chief events in the great <span class="smcap">Story of the Nations</span>;
but it is, of course, not always practicable to issue
the several volumes in their chronological order.</p>

<h3>Heroes of the Nations</h3>

<p>A series of biographical studies of the lives and
work of a number of representative historical characters
about whom have gathered the great traditions
of the Nations to which they belonged, and who have
been accepted, in many instances, as types of the
several National ideals. With the life of each typical
character is presented a picture of the National conditions
surrounding him during his career.</p>

<p>The narratives are the work of writers who are
recognized authorities on their several subjects,
and while thoroughly trustworthy as history, present
picturesque and dramatic "stories" of the Men
and of the events connected with them.</p>

<p>To the Life of each "Hero" is given one duodecimo
volume, handsomely printed in large type,
provided with maps and adequately illustrated according
to the special requirements of the several
subjects.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
